Plotting options data gives so much insight into why they are priced the way they are. If you're new to options these plots should make it really obvious why weeklies are like lotto tickets, and leaps are much more like owning the stock long term (with leverage).  I find it more helpful than a lot of broker tools, and plotting the actual data gives a quick visual representation of theta.   # QQQ  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/o45w2rc1w1u61.png?width=2357&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81ac3d03c3d17e7fb5194dba3657ff143ade3511  # SPY  [Legend is really cluttered.

The market-makers will price options based on based on well-understood underlying assumptions.   Curves of VXX with strike are inversed relative to SPY and QQQ, which I find interesting. This would probably mean the longer time goes on, the higher the expectation volatility comes back up. The higher relative cost of for OTM strikes would indicate that when VIX does eventually spike again, people are betting it will spike quite high, and you pay a premium this insurance.   With skyrocketing IV, sometimes things get out-of-wack.

mtq4ij,1618795473,PatrickSebast,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtq4ij/dd_boomer_edition_csx_earnings_this_week/,"DD: Boomer Edition - CSX earnings this week","For this week's Boomer Dick and Dividends we look once again at 🚂🚂Choo Choo!  No one knows what the fuck is going on with CLOV hard to tell with that ticker if they are selling healthcare or some other clever name for weed stonks anyway.  RIDE bombed out of their Desert race so EVs that aren't Tesla are going to remain fucked because it seems like new millennial mechanics can't figure out how to actually use a DC motor after hyping it for over a decade. (Hint: Plug in motor = ⏩⏩)   CSX is set for earnings this week and they will almost certainly beat expectations.  Why?  Well there is a handy tool to track rail traffic for CSX available on their own site to track performance metrics which includes the number of rail cars online at any given time.  https://www.csx.com/index.cfm/customers/performance-measures/  If you download the data it shows that the number of cars online hasn't been this high since 2018 (so not just beating out the pandemic numbers but smashing 2019 as well).  Previous years had much higher numbers but CSX did major efficiency cuts in 2017 that removed thousands of employees and areas that weren't running well.  (You can also see in the data velocity in 2017 was 14.7mph and is now 20mph).    The short of it is that rail traffic appears to be up about 17% (technically it is 17% more cars online at a given time) while earnings estimates are pegging it at a 7% increase.  (Example of earning estimate stating this just recently https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-report-q1-earnings-low-155803201.html)  On top of that the the rail cost index was near an all time high in Q1 (https://www.aar.org/rail-cost-indexes/) which means that prices on rail freight were UP UP UP.  So they are moving more 🚂and charging 💵💰.  If you looks at earnings estimates regardless of the firm everyone seems to be pegging them at a slight increase from 2020 when the 17% increase was a sharp and almost immediate change on the year.    If you need further confirmation from a non-CSX source the AAR also confirms that traffic is back to prepandemic levels of you remove the february blip from the Texas freeze.  CSX doesn't operate any lines in Texas so it is reasonable to assume that they weren't majorly impacted as their own data displays. https://www.aar.org/data-center/rail-traffic-data/  To top it off there is not a single part of the transportation industry that isn't struggling to meet demand right now.  CSX isn't going to be a magical exception and just have small growth when they have major lines throughout the major manufacturing centers of the Eastern US.  You can bet that they are doing it with less employees due to across the board labor shortages (listed as a concern in their annual report) and with an increasingly energy efficient line of 🚂 since they have been investing in and showing upgrades for years.  Pros:   CSX is a profit heavy industry with government support that consistently out paces SPY as a long term investment even if you ignore the 1% per year dividend.  CSX is going to beat earnings because earnings were assuming moderate recovery vs the explosive recovery we got.  Almost no reason to doubt this and no reason to doubt they continue to do well throughout the year because as you can see in sky rocketing commodities pricing we simply cannot meat the demand for materials right now.  🚂 Are much 💪 vs tiny 🚛 when it comes to moving things like wood, steel and copper across the nation to be processed.  CSX didn't get hit by the Texas shutdown as they are an east coast outlet.  This means they will look better than several competitors with lines closer to or inside of Texas  CSX like all the major railroads prints money with a 27%ish profit margin year to year.  Railroads are a lifeblood to American supply lines that tend to do alright even in bad years.  Government support and regulations keep the industry wide stability and growth in place with more and more companies realizing that rail is the ideal way to move bulk goods when you have smart systems to plan around the delivery dates.  As long as Tony Musk and Tim 🍏 don't start shooting our goods down 🧲 tubes soon railroads are going to be good for a while.    Cons: Good earnings reports don't always mean good stock prices 😕🙃.  Lots of unexpected things can come up and sometimes the stock gets bought up leading to the report and then dumped.  (Stonks did not like the last report but it also wasn't really that good).  $CSX did show very strong and steady growth after the last report so the real question is if there is a drop off on the report or not.  I lean towards no dip but it would suck to buy now and miss the dip since the last one was $10 drop 😕🚂💥.    Time based Efficiency metrics are down a bit for Q1.  Trains are slightly slower and dwell times at stations are slightly longer.  Mostly labor based but it's still an issue for the slowest form of transit to move slower (note that vs 4 years ago they are 30%+ better).  Boomer Points:.  🚂 Are an amazing and under appreciated form of transportation.  They are incredibly 👕 so the Democrats currently in power love them and they are big tough machines so Republicans tend to love them too!  It's vastly agreed upon that is long as you are a properly 💉 citizen that you will almost certainly love 🚂 and the way they follow simple patterns too!  💉💉💉💉⬆️🆙⏫=🚂🚂🚂🚂⏫🆙⬆️  Dividends: Essentially comes out to about 1% of the stock price per year if you hold it that long.  More or less free growth on something already beating SPY YOY.  Positions: I don't have any 😕.  Just saw this coming weeks earning notice has CSX.  Looked and saw it didn't appear to have a pre-earnings spike and decided that the rail data should probably show increased traffic since my companies rail cars keep getting stuck in station traffic.  The data shows a 17% increase in traffic and now I wish I had $CSX but I can't buy it til tomorrow.  Recommendations: Worst case scenario is probably that earnings randomly tank it for no good reason.  Last time it took a month to recover on bad earnings so if you aren't going to do shares then buy a call that ends a month from now.  No puts.  🚂💥🌈🐻"

From TuSimple's [S1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1823593/000119312521091150/d909743ds1.htm):  &gt; Hallmarks of our proprietary semi-truck specific technology include our 1,000 meter perception range, 35 second planning horizon, high definition (“HD”) maps with accuracy within five centimeters, and an integrated L4 autonomous semi-truck design comprising of a fully redundant sensor suite and components.  In the world of autonomous driving, L4 is the point of full automation and a human isn't needed in the vehicle at all. And technology with a 1,000 meter range doesn't exist (the 35 second "planning horizon" is a direct result of the range - it's the amount of time to react at highway speeds).  This article [discusses TuSimple's gear setup](https://www.laserfocusworld.com/test-measurement/article/14197547/autonomous-vehicle-technology-shifts-to-a-more-realistic-gear):  &gt; TuSimple equips its trucks with 10 high-definition cameras that can identify vehicles up to 1000 m away (day or night, rain or shine), giving them plenty of room to steer around other vehicles or stop when needed (see Fig. 1). Five microwave radars can detect and identify objects up to 300 m away, important if fog or rain impairs vision. A pair of lidars with 200 m range give detailed views of objects inside that range.  Let's go over that again:   * LiDAR range - 200 meters   * Microwave radar range - 300 meters   * **Magical HD cameras that claim to be able to identify vehicles 1,000 meters away - are you fucking kidding me?** I can't link to YouTube, but find the video "TuSimple's Delivers Enhanced Night Vision Capabilities with New Camera System" and you'll see that TuSimple's supposed "improved" camera is actually less clear, it's just better with headlight glare, and sure as fuck doesn't have a 1,000 meter range  They claim their technology can see [up to 1,000 meters away - triple the range of any competitor](https://www.tusimple.com/technology/), but they outsource all of their hardware and nothing on the market comes close to 1,000 meters.   &gt; Aeva Inc, a firm founded by former Apple Inc engineers to supply a key self-driving car sensor, said on Tuesday it had reached a deal to [supply the sensors for self-driving heavy duty trucks being developed by TuSimple](https://www.reuters.com/article/aeva-tusimple-idUKL1N2K102G)  Oh, and when TuSimple [tried to demonstrate how awesome its autonomous driving system is, it failed](https://www.wired.com/story/tusimple-self-driving-truck-cameras-computer-vision/):  &gt; The demo drive also, however, makes clear there’s work to be done. After 40 minutes of, uneventful robo-driving, a computer voice interrupts our conversation: “Autonomous driving off.” Without my noticing it, the safety driver has retaken control. “I’ve got a freeze on my visual,” he tells Hou. “I shut it down for safety.” A network card in that server box next to me disconnected, likely due to the truck's vibration, freezing the system's human-machine interface and blocking the bit that does the motion planning from the bit that executes its commands.  &gt; And so this flesh-and-bones human holds the wheel and works the pedals for the next 20 minutes, taking us off the highway and back to TuSimple’s garage.   TuSimple hasn't sold any of their technology. [Their revenues are from traditional trucking](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tusimple-ipo-filing-shows-self-driving-trucks-still-a-money-loser-11616535572?mod=searchresults_pos4&amp;page=1):  &gt; TuSimple has so far earned money as a traditional freight-hauler, not from selling its self-driving technology ready in 2024. It has customer reservations for more than 5,700 trucks, although those aren’t equivalent to sales revenue.  **TL;DR - $TSP claims to have self-driving technology that has three times the range of anything on the market, but haven't demonstrated it, or sold it, and the equipment they currently use is from other manufacturers. They have 70 trucks (50 in the U.S., 20 in Europe and Asia) on the road making normal freight deliveries, with "safety drivers" in the vehicles, and that's where their revenues are generated.**"

mtkyw2,1618778361,UnderstandingNo2575,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtkyw2/clov_dd_no_bullshit/,"CLOV DD - No Bullshit","CLOV has a very interesting setup right now but way too many people seem to only care about the short float debate that has been unfolding over the last few days. To sum that up: FactSet (top financial data provider) had the CLOV float listed as 23.5M and short interest at 39M - putting the percentage of the float shorted at 146.6%. This circulated online and has been argued on twitter and reddit starting Friday. Factset has since updated the float to 109.8M making the 39M short interest account for 36% of the float. They previously had deducted the CEO’s class B shares from the total class A shares, and although his shares are “non-tradeable” and shouldn't be included in the public float, they were only using the class A shares to determine the float as all class B shares are already non-tradeable unless converted - so shouldn’t have been part of the equation to begin with. Now I could get more into the ‘Hindenberg said this” and “S3 said this” bullshit that people have been arguing about...  But heres why NONE OF THAT EVEN FUCKING MATTERS  Shorts and those who have been bashing CLOV and arguing against the original short float number are taking a victory lap, like Factset updating the short float to 36% destroys the entire bullish case for CLOV and now it will tank. BULLSHIT, here’s why:  The 39M short interest number being used in the short float calculation is from 3/31. Over two weeks ago. When the two highest volume and highest short volume days in CLOV history have occurred within the last two weeks. With \~30M shares shorted on 4/8 and \~90M shares shorted on Friday (according to Fintel). We don’t know at this time how much of the short volume has since covered and would be included in the current short interest; but given all this, you could logically conclude the short float on CLOV right now could be pretty damn high. For context, 36% short float - based on outdated short interest from 3/31 - is in the ballpark of double what we're currently seeing in GME or AMC, and would still make CLOV one of the highest short float stocks in the entire market right now.  https://preview.redd.it/rvr4bslwszt61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=801f7c4f339e3573272d280586c7a9bd54d8343d  https://preview.redd.it/l4ssab8yszt61.png?width=2010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10de1da2465f375d84f5d28bdf9689936cf5af48  The short float is only a small piece of the puzzle, and it’s without a doubt high enough to trigger a short squeeze if prices continue to rise, end of story. Now let’s get into the shit that really matters.  First off, from a technical perspective, there are some good signs. (if you hate technical analysis or think you're so good at it that you'll find a way to disagree with whatever I say then skip to the next section)  https://preview.redd.it/06weuky6tzt61.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64b8a0b9d28d85d079627746c4e1832aec8f153e  * MACD bullish * RSI only starting to warm up * Decent support built between $7-$7.30 * But what’s really screaming on this chart are these two recent MASSIVE buying volume days coming after about a month of consolidation with a double bottom pattern making higher lows.  **Now let’s get into call volume**  [Some of the order that came through Friday](https://preview.redd.it/ksveumt0tzt61.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2577d77bf9ab0d6f3180c955e9af5b861f859f3b)  https://preview.redd.it/a7e1pes3tzt61.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83c9ea5a0d92808cfd65626f792fa1078443b1ed  Fridays call flow and the sheer volume and open interest on some of these call options speak for themselves. This is where I should break down the mechanics of a gamma squeeze, but really all you need to know is that heavy call volume is important for two reasons: 1) it can be a good indicator of where money is flowing in the market and 2) the people who write the call options need to buy shares to hedge against their position. The more the price rises the more shares they need to buy, helping to push price higher just like we see in a short squeeze.  &amp;#x200B;  Next, CLOV is down over 50% from Dec/Jan highs. Some of the main reasons for the drop would be:  * Money flowing out of growth stocks and SPACS * Hindenberg short report * Short seller price manipulation  The Hindenburg short attack really did a number on CLOV. The stock was trading at about $14 prior to the release of their short report and dropped over 50% in the weeks following its release.  Hindenburg attacked CLOV from many different angles. One of their main arguments being that Clover Health uses misleading and unethical marketing practices to boost sales, as evidence stating that in 2016: “Clover was fined for misleading marketing practices by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)”  Well, just this month (April 8th), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted Clover heath approval in 10 new states. CLOV has yet to release a PR on this but it has been updated on the CMS website (see picture below). The stock price jumped with huge volume on this news but short sellers were able to manipulate it back down until the spike we just saw on Friday.  https://preview.redd.it/sc2w81eatzt61.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eb791918794ff6a425e42fffa397e409788b782  It seems that Hindenbergs argument doesn’t hold up as the same federal agency (CMS) they were using to support claims against Clover Health is currently supporting Clovers expansion into 10 new states. Which is huge news for CLOV by the way.  &amp;#x200B;  **Wrapping this up**  Now say what you will about Chamath, but he had retail investors back during the GME squeeze. He promoted it, posted his personal positions, and while Wall Street, CNBC, and others attacked Gamestop, Chamath defended retail traders and the movement as a whole. It may be a total coincidence that his SPAC’s were the target of short attacks shortly after, but his support of the GME squeeze may have made him a bigger target.  Additionally, we saw Hindenberg quickly come out Friday pushing back against the CLOV short squeeze premise. This could be out of the goodness of Nathan's heart, just wanting to spread the truth… OR it could be an indication that Hindenberg and/or the short sellers they work with behind the scenes are worried and stand to loose significant money if CLOV squeeze continues. This may be our best chance to fight back against the short selling market manipulation targeted against retail - an opportunity to make Hindenburg and the short selling hedge funds they work with the next Melvin Capital. Do we let that opportunity pass by?  &amp;#x200B;  No one knows what will happen in the market, I sure as hell don’t, but given all that's been laid out here, I like the stock.  $CLOV to $100"

mtjekx,1618773516,CSMATHENGR,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtjekx/why_meta_analyses_of_financial_forecasts_are_not/,"Why meta analyses of financial forecasts are not binary: Bayesian Statistics"," Took a lot of adderall and read the jim cramer post as soon as it started to hit. Just wasted a few hours of my day writing this. I have shit to do  **Why meta analyses of financial forecasts are not binary:**  A famous argument for why Financial Analysts/Traders/Stock pushers are frauds or don’t know what they are doing is that they are barely correct out perform a coin flip in terms of the ratio of correct predictions on total predictions. While I do (most of the time) stand in the same camp of believing most analysts/stock pushers are frauds/don’t know what they are doing(at least the ones who have public followings), I don’t think this is a fair calculus or argument. I will explain why.   **Binariness:**  First off we need to define what I mean when I say Binariness. In this scenario, meta analyses will determine a prediction by being Right or Wrong by some determining metric. This metric most of the time will have some sort of dependency on time and a uniform timeframe for all the predictions(*i.e given a prediction date t1, did the the prediction come true by t2➝t1+3months?*). Being fair, they will take this statistical flaw into account and take and compare different t2 values( *t2➝t1+3weeks,  t2➝t1+6months,  t2➝t1+next quarter, etc)* but I want to exclaim that the issue is that the predictions are NOT analyzed independently, when they should/need to be.   **Why were they wrong?:**  So first off I want to clarify that predictionsCorrect/predictionsTotal is the correct calculus, but the way we quantify each variable is wrong. This section will clarify the steps need to quantify WRONG predictions CORRECTLY. Let’s assume an analyst deemed a prediction wrong, lets analyze their decision.   **Direct contradiction of the prediction:**  Let’s say(lots of assumptions but it is important to get the point across) that we have a      prediction that says “Stock x will go from $15 to  $30 by next year because of good   earnings. ” and by t2 stock x is $21. The stock price obviously did not meet the price prediction but why not? Did x have good earnings? Did they have bad earnings? In both of these specific scenarios, the predictor SHOULD be wrong. They might have been right about having good earnings but they were not right with the price prediction(so only ½ legs were met). If they had bad earnings then this was a direct contradiction of the prediction(0/2 legs were met).   **Missing leg of thesis:**  Elaborating on the above example’s outcome where ½ legs were met, it is important to     ask why this leg was missing? Did the predictor take this leg into account and disregard     it? Did they just not think of it? Either way, it is important for any predictor to think of all   variables, outcomes, and sensitivities that their thesis can be impacted by. In either of   these cases, the predictor deserves to be wrong.   **Black Swan Event:**  But what happens if an event happens that NOBODY could have predicted given the   available data? Now defining something to be a black swan event can be pretty subjective   at times. For example, a TSLA bear might not define the event when Elon Musk broke the Cyber Trucks window causing the stock price to fall as a Black Swan Event because they probably hold the thesis that their cars are shit and that their prices targets priced this in. A TSLA bull would probably defend themselves by saying that this WAS a black swan event. I’m not going to go into detail on whether these arguments are valid or not but I want to bring light to the option of throwing the data out since it is inconclusive.   **Thesis has not been satisfied:**  Now lets say an analyst is doing a meta analysis on another analysts predictions and like I said before, they take all their predictions and compare them for some constant t2 without respect to the predictions actual thesis. What happens if the the prediction has an underlying assumption that is either WAY before t2 or WAY after t2? Now the prediction will appear wrong(or right) but the underlying test is flawed, skewing the score. If the predictor says “Stock x will go from $15 to $30 by t2” but the analyst is comparing this outcome to t3 where t3 != t2, now you have a bad metric.   **Devils advocate: Why were they right?**  I don’t think I need to elaborate this side of the coin as they are  mirrors of the above but   obviously we need to cover all bases and want to make that explicit.   **Bayesian Statistics:**  This whole essay is swimming around the idea of Bayesian Statistics, or Bayes Theorem of conditional probability:   P(A|B) =P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)  This says the probability of event A GIVEN that event B is true is equal to **(**the probability of event B GIVEN that event A is true**)\*(**the probability of event A happening**)** all divided by **(**the probability of event B happening**).** Now, I won’t continue with the maths but I want to get across that this is the framework that should be used when quantifying a correctness metric. A metric that scores an outcome with respect to its thesis happening. After basing each right or wrong on its underlying factor, you will receive a bayesian approached ratio of totalCorrect/totalPredictions.   **Conclusion:**  Hopefully this made sense and hopefully you learned something. I’m not going to proof read this either because I need to go to the gym and finish my day. I got caught in writing this because I took a bunch of adderall and didn’t see where the time went. Fuck  **TL:DR**  Don’t trust all articles that say “\[Your fav analyst\] is only right 50% of the time!”. Many people who try to discredit an analysts outcomes are not using the correct metric in order to determine correctness."
mth8b4,1618766856,Radish-Perfect,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mth8b4/psfe_dd/,"PSFE DD","Paysafe is a new entrant to the fintech field. They went public via spac titled ' **Foley Trasimene Acquisition II Corp** '. And just like every other SPAC in the last 6 months, the stock price has run up then gotten crushed. I personally hate spacs, however if the underlying company is valuable once the merger is complete they can be a good investment.   The Spac is sponsored by Bill Foley, a notable entertainment investor. He made a fortune investing in wineries, golf courses, sports franchises, and hotels. Their CEO is Phil Mchugh, who has a track record working at citibank and barclays. Overall the management team seems pretty impressive. (Especially considering citi handles all wire transfers on earth. The CEO has a lot of experience with credit and merchant payments. I did notice that his linkdin profile is written in the third person, which could be a red flag.   Paysafe is fundamentally a transaction handler. They serve mostly medium and smaller merchants, and transfer money between merchants, currencies, and forms of credit. They have some larger customers, notably including fortnite, twitch, and spotify. The firm handled 92 billion $ of transactions in 2020. They focus much of their business on gaming, and gambling. Which are both attractive and growing markets.   Taking a look at the companies SEC filings, the notable risk factors they list include risk due to brexit, risk of accidentally processing fraudulent claims, and heavy reliance on third parties for much of their processes (payment processing, banking, routing/connectivity, customer support, IT). This leaves me with the question what do they really do? My understanding is that the company provides value to customers by the middleman and acting as a connection between merchants, local banks, and larger financial institutions. They process payments and take a processing fee.   Other notable risks would be the major competitors that the company faces in the fintech world. They are partnered with visa and mastercard, but will have to compete with COIN, SQ, SOFI and many others.   Advantages? The firm has a solid hold in the European and international markets. It's in a quickly growing industry, and has good leadership.   &amp;#x200B;  Finances.  PSFE has a market cap of 2.47 Billion$(despite being purchased for $9billion, hmm). Their trailing 12 months revenue is $1.4 billion, and their gross profit was $891 million or 62.5%, very nice.   The market cap/gross profit ratio is 2.47bil/891mil=2.77. At this ratio the company is very attractively priced. (If you bought the entire company, you'd make 100% profit in 2.77 years assuming no change in valuation). For reference, this ratio on a few other firms.  PLTR-68  COST-6.3  AAPL-19.1  MCD- 17.1  INTC-6.03  SPOT-27  SQ-42.6  PYPL-31.6  VISA-28.8  Relatively speaking, the price/earnings on this company is really low. Especially compared to their most similar competitors PYPL and SQ.   Taking a look at the balance sheet it isn't so sexy, they have a lot of liabilities and long term debt. Not the worst I've seen, they still have more assets. Their quick ratio is 1.35. Perhaps this explains the low P/E.   &amp;#x200B;  Overall, the company has stiff competition, but good leadership and valuable customers. They are also specializing in a very attractive market. The company is very undervalued in my opinion, and could potentially have a significant run up to reach a more reasonable multiplier. If it's multiplier were to be similar to its peer (SQ,PYPL), the company would 15x in valuation.   I started off this DD hating this company because it was a SPAC, however after looking into it I think I may invest."

I decided to bring out the ol' Excel to get some data on the SPY over the last 12-months to measure the money flow, and I found something super interesting.   Money flow is essentially the inflow and outflow of money coming into a particular company, asset class, or security. It's a good way of measuring market participation in a given asset class. Higher market participation in bullish times often takes equities to new highs, but in bearish times it becomes a drag on equity prices. When money flow oscillates in tighter intervals, we tend to see more spikes in volatility rather than when it oscillates slightly or not at all.   Let us take a lot at the SPY and the charts representing it. We have the price index, the total flows, the inflow(+) and outflow (-), and the net flow charts. Taking all of this information together, you may see where I come to the conclusion of why the market is overdo for a little more volatility, which means that VIX options are in play for the next few weeks most likely.  [This is the price index of the SPY on a per day basis over a 12-month period. We have reaching higher highs in the recent weeks while volatility has been dropping. This is a classic bearish sign for the market. Not to say that we will see a correction by any means, just a little bit more volatility, I think. Like I said, high volatility in a bull market is good. In a bear market, not so much.](https://preview.redd.it/hbfiz3fwcut61.png?width=2475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4910cea6eea6159d41c54f078e49d8e623051df6)  [This  is the total flows on a per day basis over the same period of time. As you can see, volatility dropped in the most recent weeks in comparison to those before and the SPY went up. Reiterating: it's a bearish signal based on historical measurements. But expecting volatility is not the same as saying I'm a bear. I'm just seeing perhaps more swings in the weeks to come to both the downside and the upside. If we're in bullish mindset, the price will trend up. If bears take over, hold on to your hats.](https://preview.redd.it/bwqkuld1dut61.png?width=2486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a093c106910abe22916074072cb7df322f8dff17)  [This is the inflow\/outflow chart over the same period of time. Notice the higher frequency on the left-side of the chart vs the right-side. This tells me that there is higher market activity as larger volumes of inflows and outflows are happening in tighter spreads, thus giving the \\"clustered\\" effect. As we look towards the right-side of the graph, we see a lower frequency as inflow and outflow activity isn't so active and the spreads look \\"looser.\\" The money flow frequency can change at any moment but just be aware that the frequency starts going higher because of an event that forces it. Often that event happens after a low frequency environment. We are currently in a low frequency environment.](https://preview.redd.it/gy3vyq0idut61.png?width=2466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbca5977189fdc9e7e6e30d1d3e55396b6a19c85)  [This graph represents the net total flows per month. The peaks \(i.e. turning points\) show where the CBOE Volatility Index \(VIX\) has stabilized. Since the last spike in the VIX around late January\/early February, we haven't seen the VIX consolidate at a bottom. The data for April is only partially available because the month isn't complete, so do not take the line upward following the last turning point as a definite sign of stabilization. However, if we can assume that the final line going upward will average the current rate of return that is already there, then we may be due for a stabilization test soon.](https://preview.redd.it/v4e4xp2ceut61.png?width=2173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d4c0a2c3b3b7ab1c7426e42db700438c644f425)  You can see the correlations between the VIX stabilization and the net flow peaks around the period by comparing the chart above with the one below.  https://preview.redd.it/oc2wlpcbfut61.png?width=902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f599b35562d2b4494e138b98de2358ea5de66052  Based on this argument, I think we may start seeing the VIX consolidate at around this level. We're in a low frequency environment, the perfect spot for when high frequency starts to kick in. After a test of stabilization, we either see a sharp move upwards or the continuation of a slow decay before it gets retested again. Are we at a place of consolidation, or are we quickly approaching one? I don't know for certain, but I like to follow the money."

For those following today's race in Baja in which Lordstown Motors entered a souped up version of their EV truck "Endurance," hopefully you're already trying to figure out what to do with your positions Monday at open. For those who didn't follow the race,  despite what Lordstown released on Facebook and Twitter, it really can't be viewed as anything other than a disaster.   The truck's battery gave out at mile 40, at which point the driver (who is apparently a janitor or security guard at LM) veered a mile off course so they could recharge. The truck sat not moving for around two hours before taking the wrong route to get back on course and finally deciding to just turn around and drive back to the start via the highway.   Honestly, that's not the worst part.  Lordstown posted a video to Instagram showing the truck in action during the race.  It was *ahem* ...underwhelming. My 68 year old mother would have passed them on the shoulder in her 10 year old Chevy Malibu and flipped them the bird for driving like a bitch. One of the biggest concerns many have had about this truck is that having the motors in the wheel hubs versus mounted to the body would cause serious issues on bumpy terrain and lead to the motors being rendered inoperable when you hit a pothole. The video of them driving Miss Daisy though the Baja desert did not assuage these fears for me.  Perhaps it did for others. Perhaps I'm overreacting.   I had hoped to see them go balls to the wall.  Announce their presence with aplomb and say "Here we are, America! Come get yours off the line in September!" At least then if it broke down (like literally 50% of the entrants in this race), you could at least say "Hey, we went for it.  We've got some things to work on before next year's race, but the truck is still a winner." Instead, they drove it like a 90 year old who is driving for the first time in their life five minutes after smoking their first fatty. And they still broke down 40 miles into the 250 mile race. Really disappointing.   So, positions.   200 shares @ 11.95 average that I expect to lose value as I will continue to hold long term.   15 4/23C $13 25 4/23C $12 25 4/23C $10 10 4/23P $8   The options were stupid and overly optimistic, but I bought them as lottery tickets hoping that Lordstown would push the truck to the limits today.  They didn't.   My only source of hope right now is that this market makes no sense.  Maybe they'll shake this off and spike Monday. Should have joined the theta gang and sold some covered calls of my shares."

This high short interest stuff has already been debunked it looks like. The high short interest shown was a mistake by Factset and the short% of float is way way lower. Short interest is actually only about 35% of float, which is moderately high but not anywhere remotely close to the 145% being spread around.  1. Institutional shares like Vanguard that are counted in the post are freely tradable and are never deducted from a float calculation. 2. Clover’s publicly traded equity are Class A shares. Clover’s CEO only holds Class B shares. The screenshot shows that FactSet accidentally thought CEO Garipalli’s 83 million Class B shares were Class A shares. They were not, but because of the mistake FactSet subtracted them from the calculation of Class A float, which led to the mistakenly low number.  In other words, the screenshot of the “evidence” actually debunks this thesis.  There are about 109.8 million shares in the free float, and FactSet, Bloomberg, and Reuters are now all in agreement on that. But when FactSet subtracted 83 million from that by mistake it made it look like the float was only \~27 million (109.8 - 83) which made it look like the short interest as a % of float was massive.  FactSet corrected their numbers today. S3 Partners (which was cited in media and relied on FactSet) will likely correct next, then the handful of media articles that cited S3 (and indirectly FactSet) will probably correct as well.  There are actually a ton of shares available to short (30 million) according to IHS Markit, another short data provider. The cost to borrow is cheap at about 1.5-2%. None of this is consistent with a squeeze scenario.  Want to find high short interest names like everyone else but this is just not the one."

"Godzilla vs. Kong" has infused new life into the jungle and a struggling US box office in 2020, prompting an upward revision in 2Q estimates across Wall Street. Yet it's too soon to draw conclusions. Film delays and "day-and-date," or studios streaming movies on the same day as their theatrical release, are risks.   ***1)  "Godzilla vs Kong" to Top Box Office Again***  It's is expected to top box-office charts for a third consecutive weekend with an estimated $8.7 million, bringing gross receipts to $82.6 million, according to Box Office Pro. California's ArcLight shut down last week, Regal's staggered reopening will continue, so the lack of new films this week should pull total receipts 25-30% lower, based on Box Office Pro estimates. ArcLight and Regal should give AMC an edge going into final spring months and even the early months of the summer when Box Office blockbusters usually get released.   *Processing img bf44qo0oust61...*  ***2) US Vaccine Available To All in 2Q; Theatres Also Gets Shot in Arm With Reopenings***  With cinemas only gradually reopening, 1Q21's box office totaled just under $240 million, an 87% plunge from the $1.83 billion in 1Q20. While that's not totally surprising, 2Q results will be much better, given the success of "Godzilla vs. Kong" even with only 55% of cinemas open. As Regal &amp; AMC reopens more of its theaters in April, 2Q box office may hit $650 million, based on Box Office pro's projections, despite Disney's decision to release highly anticipated summer movies "Cruella" and "Black Widow" on its Disney+ service at the same time as they're available in theaters. Warner's "Mortal Kombat" will be out on April 16.   &amp;#x200B;  *Processing video yksi6cvgwst61...*  ***3)  'Godzilla vs. Kong' Monstrous Open Roars Box Office Back to Life Around the World***  Following a strong international open, Warner Bros. "Godzilla vs. Kong" U.S. release had high expectations leading into the long Easter weekend. Those receipts, coming in slightly above the $13.5 million [the studio initially reported](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/box-office-godzilla-vs-kong-nobody-1234948900/) on Sunday, propel the film’s overall tally to $70 million. After two weeks of release, “[Godzilla vs. Kong](https://variety.com/t/godzilla-vs-kong/)” already ranks as the highest-grossing movie of the pandemic era, surpassing Christoper Nolan’s puzzling sci-fi thriller “Tenet,” which ended its theatrical run with $58.4 million.  (Source: Variety Magazine / Variety.com).  This as a step in the right direction leading into the summer blockbuster period as hybrid day-and-date release strategies aren't deterring fans from the theatrical experience. As more vaccines are distributed and theater capacity restrictions are relaxed, expect continued higher box-office receipts.   *Processing img ibudrjf9yst61...*  ***4)  AMC Re-Opens California Cinema To Kick-Off Summer Early***  In a small step toward recovery in the global film industry, AMC, the largest theater operator in the world, announced the reopening of 54 of its California locations in March.

Over the last two days many people all over every social media platform have been in debate as to what $CLOV's real float count is and what the real short interest as a % of the Float is. I am here to explain what went wrong in FactSet's calculations (which have now been fixed BTW: [source](https://imgur.com/gallery/HocOE0G)) and to calculate the float by hand using information and data provided in $CLOV's 10k to confirm the validity. Feel free to criticize any of the data presented.  Here are some facts that are not being widely disputed for reference:  * There are 145,345,832 Class A shares outstanding -[source](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521102551/d89571d10k.htm) * The CEO owns 0 Class A shares -[source](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521102551/d89571d10k.htm) * There are 38,504,281 Shares Short as of March 31st 2021- source: FactSet can't provide link but it seems as though this figure is not being disputed.  What is being disputed specifically is the number of shares that are part of the publicly traded float:  Yesterday FactSet reported that float was \~26.3M shares down from what they were reporting 2 days ago at \~109.8M shares. FactSet had subtracted 83.5M shares from the float making the denominator in the SI/Float equation plummet causing the short interest% to skyrocket to 140%+. FactSet incorrectly made this subtraction. **The CEO's shares were NEVER part of FactSet's calculated Float to begin with.** FactSet's float had always consisted of tradable Class A shares, yet it subtracted the CEO's Class B shares from the float. My guess is that someone challenged the data provided by FactSet and an analyst at FactSet changed the number according to the challenge but did not spend the time to properly verify the validity of the data they were changing. Now the number has been changed back to 109M shares float.  &amp;#x200B;  Now for the 10k:  &amp;#x200B;  [10K color coded](https://preview.redd.it/asn64bf8hst61.jpg?width=1708&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e98280fa82eb00501fdaa8e5d10d811a678b65f0)  This 10k is very easily misinterpreted without looking at the subscripts at the bottom. There is so much overlap when it comes to shares owned. Reading the subscript #3 at the bottom we can see that **Chamath's 30M shares are overlapped with the 20M and 10M shares owned by SCH Sponser III LLC and ChaChaCha SPAC C LLC** respectively. This means that the shares owned by SCH Sponsor III LLC + the shares owned by ChaChaCha SPAC C LLC + the shares owned by Chamath's = 30,500,000.   Further, Entities affiliated with Ian Osborne also own 25,500,000 Class A shares. As we above, 20,500,000 of those shares are from SHC Sponsor III LLC **which are already included in Chamath's 30,500,000 Class A shares.** This leaves an extra 5M shares owned by Ian Osborne that are not related to entities owned by Chamath.   Therefore, there are 30,500,000 + 5,000,000 = 35,500,000 Class A shares owned by Insiders and locked up. **The rest, 145,345,832 - 35,500,000 =  109,845,832, are part of the Float.**   Taking the #of shares short and dividing by the Float that we calculated gives us:  (38,504,281 /  109,845,832) \* 100 = **35.05301958 % of float being shorted.**  Now to clear up some more misconceptions:  [Vanguard's 26,185,529 Class A shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000110465921049151/tv0001-cloverhealthinvestmen.htm) are completely tradable and not locked up whatsoever and therefore, are still part of the float.  *Processing img qxzqcfeajst61...*  It is clear from a close reading of the 10k that there are many things wrong with the data here:  1. Vanguard should not be considered as part of the Class A Lockup shares since they can freely trade AND lend shares. Therefore, those 26,185,529 shares **should not** be subtracted from the shares outstanding. 2. The creator of this table failed to realize that Chamath's 30M shares are the same as SCH Sponsor III and ChaChaCha SPAC C's shares and mistakenly subtracts them from the shares outstanding twice. Further, 20M of Ian Osborne's shares are wrongly being subtracted as well since they are overlapped with SCH Sponsor III.  Also why are people all of a sudden so keen on listening to S3 Partners? Did people all of a sudden forget who owns them? (Its Citadel)."
msy7zx,1618690626,sweetsweettendies,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msy7zx/extremely_thorough_clov_recent_action_dd/,"Extremely thorough CLOV recent action DD","I’m going to go back a little bit in time and tell you how CLOV was directly related to GME squeeze. So when GME was squeezing two very influential people have backed the squeeze and caused it to squeeze even more. Those two people were Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya. Both partners in previous endeavors and friends.  GME squeeze hurt short seller Hindenburg so much that they have lost 40% of their account that week.  CLOV is backed by Chamath Palihapitiya. Hindenburg, in order to retaliate at Chamath for causing them huge losses, published a short seller report for CLOV few days after Chamath tweeted about GME. Short seller report had very little base, yet that caused the stock to drop and also SEC had to initiate an investigation due to the claims.  Since then stock got beaten down to less than IPO prices. What does that mean? It means that it was moved not so much by true owners of the stock, but mostly by short sellers. That will play in nicely in the squeeze because short sellers always have to close out, but if stock is still held by their true purchasers it means that there are even less shares available for active trading.     Enough of history. Retail following:  Since GME endeavor Chamath PAlihapitiya joined the club of “retail gods”.... he is one of the poster babies for retail movement on hurting short sellers. His previous partnerships with Elon Musk furthers retail following so now not only we have GME crowd supporting Chamath, but also Tesla crowd. Both of those stocks were some of the most successful trades in history.     Friday’s Hindenburg’s fright with CLOV:  On Friday CLOV has opened with 148% short interest and after this was noticed by retail the squeeze has started. The volume topped 250M shares traded (10x average daily volume and 5x its previous heaviest volume day). (Ill get in to more technicals later, but needed to mention this to push the narrative). Hindenburg saw the action and protecting their possible short position tweeted that FactSet has misleading short interest data about CLOV not including CEOs clad B shares in the float.  FactSet came back to Hindenburg’s allegations with a reply that CEOs type B shares are classified as not tradable and are not included in the float. And once again confirmed that stock is 148% short. This further angered retail traders and a lot of chatter online has started how Hindenburg is trying to manipulate this stock with lies and deceit.  A lot of people didn’t catch on on Friday but through the night and this afternoon Reddit and stock twits seem to have exploded about it, videos are popping up on YouTube. A lot of traction is being created over the weekend for a sweet Monday open.     Technicals: *CLOV free float is 109mil  *CLOV shares outstanding are 406mil *78% of CLOV shares are owed by insiders and are still locked up. Insiders are only allowed to sell if stock hits $30 and stays above $30 for 90 days  *institutional ownership of CLOV is at 48%  *the volume on Friday was 249mil shares which only represents 61% turn over for shares outstanding, but if you take locked up shares out of consideration, true turn over was actually 228%, meaning every share available to trade was bought and sold at least twice on Friday.   A lot of people that bought on Friday (including NEXT financial group that bought 21,400 shares) will not likely be actively trading this week meaning available shares short term will continue on decreasing.  In my speculation out of 109 mil free float Only around 35% of shares will be available to trade this week. Here is how I got to this number:  -institutions owe 48% of stock and they are not likely to trade short term fluctuations, but giving it a benefit of doubt let’s say that institutions that will hold account only to 30% of float. Now we only have 70% of float left to trade.... -let’s assume that investors that owe CLOV long term account for 20% of the float. A lot of them don’t check stocks daily or sometimes even weekly. Let’s assume that half of them even won’t notice what is happening this week. At this point we only have 50% of float left to trade.  -the rest of the free float is being traded by scalpers/ day traders, swing traders and “diamond handers”. This is a very educated group and unless scalping or pattern trading will understand that we are in the middle of the squeeze and hold. I believe this group will contribute to another 15% of float being unavailable, assuming half of them will be trading fluctuations and half holding.  So my conclusion is: only 35% of available shares will be circulating next week being sold and bought over and over again. That’s only 38mil shares not being stuck in someone’s account semi permanently. Some more liquidity will be provided short term by other shorters flocking in, but I won’t take them in consideration because they too have to close out at some point.   Fallowing all this speculative, yet very carefully vetted math let’s calculate the demand for the shares, just to close short positions -148% of the free float is shorted, meaning 161mil shares will be in demand just to close out short positions. Since we already established that there will be only 38mil shares freely circulating in the market each short share will only have 0.24 shares. So looks like there are 4 times less shares than demand to close short positions! Throw in some buying activity to that math and you have a number closer to 10:1.   Following all of that the question is how far the stock can go during this particular squeeze? Well the answer is: it’s mathematically impossible to calculate. Although there are some indicators of what people can expect. Smaller the float, the bigger the short interest and the heavier the volume the further it can go. In this particular instance we have the combination of all three factors. Even if it’s impossible to predict exactly what price short squeeze will hit, it’s possible to trade short squeeze well using technical indicators and trade management. Monitoring volume, daily short interest and days to cover should be adequate. To know when short squeeze is ending I monitor same indicators that made me spot the short squeeze to start with, but in reverse. Meaning volume will start to tapper off, short percentage decrease and the upwards momentum will start to whilt. I also watch out for extremely sudden, needle like falls (trailing stop loss domino effect).   I hope the read was interesting and I haven’t lost you half way through.   I won’t go into any CLOV fundamentals or any of that good stuff cause I think we already established that everything is in order there. It is also completely irrelevant in a mathematical squeeze."

It’s also somewhat unusual for being an active, fully transparent manager of ETFs.  &amp;#x200B;   Cathie Wood runs 7 different ETF's (of AT LEAST 1 year in existence) and they all have gone up from 177% to 391% in the last 16 months or from January 1,2020 to present.

Did NOT include the ARKX fund or Ark Space Exploration &amp; Innovation ETF since it is less than 1 month old, with a March 30,2021 inception date.  Hard to believe but the results AND charts speak for themselves .  Even if you took out the March 2020 LOW prices and went with January 2020 or February 2020 highs (high share prices BEFORE the Covid19 or coronavirus stock market crash of March 2020),the results are nevertheless extremely impressive.

In both mutual funds and ETFs, investors are effectively pooling cash to buy assets by buying shares in the fund. However, mutual funds can only be purchased at the end of each trading day, while ETFs can be bought and sold INTRADAY.  Mutual funds tend to have higher minimum investment requirements and often charge higher fees.  "For most investors, ETFs are more tax efficient, as their structure allows them to minimize capital gains".  Although both come in actively-managed and passive forms, the majority of ETFs track indexes, while mutual funds are more commonly actively run by an investment manager.  &amp;#x200B;     Cathie Wood : Worth $250 million as of October 13,2020 : Truly self-made and EXTREMELY successful.

How does the business work? Cohu makes capital equipment for testing semi’s. They have two businesses, selling capital equipment to other firms, and offering testing to companies that want to outsource that process.   We all know that there is a global semiconductor shortage, which is a strong catalyst. But the real catalyst is increasing volume. The number of semiconductors per phone is increasing. With 5g devices, there are nearly twice as many chips per phone as compared to 4g. This means twice as much testing. Additionally, with the move to electric vehicles, the automotive testing segment is growing rapidly. Cars that used to have only a few chips, are now crammed full of them. This trend of increasing chip volume is true for PC’s, phones, electric vehicles, self driving vehicles, IOT, cloud computing, and ai development. All of these growing industries have one thing in common, the need for lots of semiconductors to continue driving innovation.   Financially cohu is a very attractive stock, even having nearly tripled in the past year. With a nice 42% profit margin and growing revenues, the company is still fairly price.

I assume you apes have had a little exposure to the Cell &amp; Gene Therapy (C&amp;GT) industry when you're jerkin off on the couch to Cathie Woods and her $ARKG fund while your wife and her boyfriend are in the master bedroom, but then again probably not.  So, please read the preamble before throwing your shit all over my DD.  **Key Points on Cell and Gene Therapy Industry**  C&amp;GT is a long time in the making and many (including several Nobel prize winning) discoveries had to coalesce but the industry is finally starting to hit major inflection points. One of the major subcategories within C&amp;GT are "cell-based gene therapies" like CAR-T cell therapy. A patient's (or donor's) T cell is genetically engineered to express a CAR which drives the T cell towards the cancer cells. There are 5 FDA approved CAR-T cell therapies on the market. Below is a table from Wikipedia with more info on them.  https://preview.redd.it/wk1h7t06sqt61.png?width=2228&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=798b37452937b4018f93f1939d5794ca80d2fc1a  There are many other subcategories within C&amp;GT and many other types of "cell-based gene therapies" beyond CAR-T cell therapy.  Not all of these require genetic engineering, FYI.  On January 15, 2019 commissioners from the [FDA issued a bullish statement](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-and-peter-marks-md-phd-director-center-biologics) on the C&amp;GT industry and here are some highlights:  1. "The FDA is witnessing a surge of cell and gene therapy products entering early development, evidenced by a large upswing in the number of investigational new drug (IND) applications." 2. "We anticipate that by 2020 we will be receiving more than 200 INDs per year, building upon our total of more than 800 active cell-based or directly administered gene therapy INDs currently on file with the FDA." 3. "And by 2025, we predict that the FDA will be approving 10 to 20 cell and gene therapy products a year based on an assessment of the current pipeline and the clinical success rates of these products.  &amp;#x200B;  When you look at the [FDA's IND Receipts for Biologics](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/ind-activity/ind-receipts) in 2018, we see that 1594 INDs were filed. This was a below average year compared to the 1614 (+/-70) INDs that were filed, on average, from 2014 through 2019. It is important to remember that there was a "surge" of C&amp;GT products entering the early development landscape BEFORE the pandemic because this implies that the share of C&amp;GT IND receipts is growing in a pie of \~1600 new INDs per year. In 2020, the FDA received 2182 INDs.  The "surge" in C&amp;GT products entering early development the FDA noted in their early 2019 statement was a mere prelude to the 2020 surge in C&amp;GT therapy products entering early development as evidenced by large upswings in the number of new INDs.  Unfortunately, there are many risks involved with investing in early, mid, or late stage biologic drug developers because of their high cash burn rate and constant threat of dilution. Obviously the tendies can be nice if some of these companies get acquired but that's a tough game to play. IMO, you are much better off finding a company that provides the C&amp;GT industry with all the reagents, consumables, and instruments that these developers and institutions use to conduct R&amp;D and development work. **Enter, $TECH**.  [Bio-techne](https://www.bio-techne.com/) is a NE Minneapolis, MN based company that has largely grown through acquisitions. It's largest subsidiary is R&amp;D Systems, a company that has been providing research grade reagents to the biotech industry for 50 years. That brand is well known and have a great reputation. They have quietly acquired many other brands quite strategically which will enable them to service the growing C&amp;GT industry new ways like: GMP reagents for use in the expanding clinical and commercial landscape, gene editing technology (including CRISPR/Cas9 and other non-viral methods), contract development and manufacturing services, analytical instrumentation and assays, etc. [See here for full list of Bio-techne brands.](https://www.bio-techne.com/about/bio-techne-brands)      **The Metaphorical Stars Align**  Not only is $TECH a fundamentally sound company with strong analyst reviews (see my E\*Trade snapshot below), but stars are soon to be aligning that you apes need to be aware of.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/wsg0x75buqt61.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54ac420faf1639b3284219bdb99bd5cbbf7fa622  **On 4/20, $TECH will break through its $420 resistance**.

I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.  # Video Games &amp; Heutagogic Learning  It appears clear these days that video games are the most dominant form of media. This is because the video game industry can better access and more aggressively capture our high-barrier entry need for adventure and journey. Other industries compete with this element but ultimately place their customers in the spectator's seat. For example:  1. The short stories on social media like Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or Twitter.  2. The hero tales created by Disney or Netflix.  &amp;#x200B;  [Gaming as the leader in entertainment or media](https://preview.redd.it/xms6g6ksvpt61.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e84e0655c99280e464931f3da513e33404fbdee6)  One must remember that the attention-economy fundamentally depends on on key metric: **engagement**. It is no secret why organizations like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or even Tesla have further intersected with gaming in aggressive maneuvers in recent years as a result of this economic condition. Gaming is a big winner of the attention-economy and often sits at the frontier of new economies.  When looking at age, gaming or other medias can be the shortest path to reaching new or lifelong customers. It is a lucrative and difficult position to acquire or maintain.  &amp;#x200B;  Think of it historically; during the first iterations of the web, many customers were fearful of putting credit-card information online while online gaming companies have ventured into selling branded debit cards that sold to children and youth that otherwise did not have access to banking. Roblox takes this nature a step further by effectively defining and supporting Robux-to-fiat economy as the lifeblood of the company.   &amp;#x200B;  [First generation fintech and banking services](https://preview.redd.it/72qme0crxpt61.png?width=353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cadb26b801c61afe73a8a96cb16a0024c66e316b)  I’ve discussed internet media, user incentives, and their distinctions in a previous DD involving Pinterest. To highlight one of main ideas:  &gt;"An internet forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. In my view, it ranks like the following list, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:   &gt;   &gt; 1. Google is fueled by customer’s need for answered information.   &gt;   &gt;2. Online video games are fueled by a customer’s need for adventure.   &gt;   &gt;3. Reddit is fueled by a customer’s need for community.   &gt;   &gt; 4. Pinterest is fueled by a customer’s need for ideas.   &gt;   &gt;5. Facebook is fueled by a customer’s need to connect."  In this DD, I would argue that gaming is one of the most comprehensive applications of internet forums that can encapsulate all of the needs above and dig deeper into the ideas that drive it.   &amp;#x200B;  [The investment incentive: low barrier to entry &amp; decentralized game development](https://preview.redd.it/hmibns2pzpt61.png?width=1303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a08c1a1680665d6f9272f3cff8ab19bb68f3f3ed)  I typically do not like to assert authority on a subject when I write DD, but I feel that in this case it is necessary due to an enormous complexities behind education technology, what's wrong with it, and what needs to be corrected.  In short, my view is that video games are one of the most powerful ways to engage students in a meaningful and long-lasting education, ranging from social to reading skills.   &amp;#x200B;  [Heutagogic learning](https://preview.redd.it/rq9dxj9yzpt61.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4fbe53adde74b85313ca4dca53077e14de64983)  Online games fulfill a similar shortcoming that traditional medias fail in regards to adventure or journey.  In the same fashion, education and the art of teaching generally stutters when the student remains a spectator for too long.  What gaming achieves as an education service are all the critical requirements of a healthy STEM education:  &amp;#x200B;  1. The ability to inspire curiosity and confidence.  2. The ability to deeply engage.  3. The ability to produce imagination or creativity.  Some of us may scoff about this, but there is a lot of truth to this sentiment that I believe many would agree with. For many early online child gamers, skills like typing quickly, bartering, multiplying, reading comprehension, or the desire to pursue arts originates from our time spent engaged by video games.   This is the goal and nature of heutagogic learning. This nature extends to adulthood, as many of us experienced this phenomenon while learning about advanced financial instruments for the sake of "learning the game"  of stock market investing. We spend time scowering through forums and generating a community no different than that of popular online games.  Many of us have even acquired generational knowledge as a result of this media condition. We have met the proper requirements and incentives for a STEM education at scale.     [Andragogic\/Heutagogic learning at scale](https://preview.redd.it/gplo1bx41qt61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=715bae2a0ff447bd5d21569bcac401c636c69dae)  I could talk length about this subject alone, but simply put, the world is not quite ready to accept such an idea. Games are still seen as entertainment, but it typically evolves each generation. In my generation, three societal transformations occurred:  1. It stopped being weird to purchase in-game cosmetics.  2. The idea of watching others play video games was normalized.  3. E-Sports became popular and inspired a new economy.  &amp;#x200B;  [Second generation online gaming](https://preview.redd.it/4bt555i62qt61.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c281084802f3ff72cb8143b40761bde4fa9e5ed)  Some of these resistances are interesting when you look at it from a simpler lens. Why was it weird to watch others play video games online, when it was seemingly normal to watch someone play Dance Dance Revolution in an arcade or an older sibling progress through a game? Why was it strange to purchase cosmetic goods where we spend a large percentage of our time in digital worlds? Why was it bizarre to see dedicated players compete at global levels when gaming and online access became a worldwide normalcy? Usually there is no good reason for the psychological resistance to change.  Yet here we are, playing and learning effectively one of the most popular mobile games in the US.  &amp;#x200B;  # STEAM Pedagogy - Arts in STEM  &amp;#x200B;  [STEAM pedagogy for architecture, engineering, or construction](https://preview.redd.it/b57peu7j2qt61.png?width=2782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e6ce51e01691091ff6dbeee88ff1dad985a2ff7)  With that idea covered, I want to transition to examine one of the leading pedagogies in US education, which is the inclusion of arts in STEM, known as a STEAM pedagogy.  It may not be immediately clear why the inclusion is such a drastic change to STEM, but one should consider several factors:  1. STEM education standards are poor with low engagement (a societal problem)  2. Good science and engineering requires confident students (resisting imposter syndrome)  3. STEM requires creativity and imagination (critical thinking requisites)  &amp;#x200B;  [Game development, code, or design](https://preview.redd.it/556dqhnp3qt61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6b4a2ac6c89a435890fcd01210026208aae9337)  What an arts education does is fundamentally produce new language and learning skills that are actively applied in a STEM education. Typically speaking, arts is also far more engaging to youth while traditional STEM learning models can carry less obvious inherent incentives.    However, slowly but surely, we are beginning to see students who seek to learn digital art, coding, investing and other STEAM-derived interests that can transition into other branches of STEM as a result of incentivizing the desire to learn these skills.  A young Roblox game developer is only a short path away from finding a passion in architecture or cloud computing. This strategy is not new and has had success for organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk, and other technical skills. These are largely andragogic forms of learning, or adult-centered educations.    &amp;#x200B;  One of the most significant accomplishments of the inclusion of Arts in a STEM-centered education is the inversion of a question that afflicted many classrooms for generations:  &gt; “Why do I need to learn this?”  It turns out, the answer is not   &gt;“so you can become a scientist!”   but to provide an environment that encourages and incentivizes a proper learner's mentality  &gt;“I need to learn this, so that I can create that.”  &amp;#x200B;  Engineers and scientists are simply disciplined creators no different than an artist or performer. However, there are significant and clear barriers to entry to STEM-based and Arts-based learning. It is far more pragmatic for a child to inspire creative behaviors with a canvas, skateboard, or instrument while the barrier to entry for engineering practices may be far less accessible.    Some of this is partially a consequence of time, where there has been less knowledge transfer on writing software vs. writing prose and some of these barriers have compounding consequences at the socioeconomic level.  For example, there is a large disparity in big tech hirings, and such consequences can carry over to other multi-trillion dollar industries driven by infrastructure and Green New Deal policies.  &amp;#x200B;  [Socioeconomic consequences in education support](https://preview.redd.it/t2mh2ikz3qt61.png?width=987&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ed2aadf47bb21e36d44864efe58303c20119d74)  Another huge barrier to entry to STEM is simply the fact that many students do not believe in themselves or have not been encouraged to imagine that they are capable of achieving success in subjects like mathematics and science, so there is an enormous amount of undue self-filtering in the field. Learning how to dance is a far more engaging practice to a child, while learning how to code in some developer environment without the proper incentive may seem pointless. Organizations like Roblox can and are changing the equation for some students.  You may be at a loss at this point, but it's worth taking the time to simply ponder on this and what it means economically for Roblox. The language used here is directly aligned with the language used in the Roblox S-1 registration document:  1. Inspiration mentioned 9 times.  2. Create and inspiration mentioned 75 times.  3. Engagement mentioned 160 times.  This language is particular due to the game identifying with its original iteration, Interactive Physics, an education game that launched in 1989.   &gt;"The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at the time."  &amp;#x200B;  [1989](https://preview.redd.it/s0pl9rby5qt61.png?width=583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2aba26a92988fee33e889e1bc394a3a226216978)  &amp;#x200B;  # The Roblox Vision  &gt;"We focus our business on our developers, creators, and users, and acting in their interests in the long-term may conflict with the short-term expectations of analysts and investors."  &amp;#x200B;  [EBP - Engagement Based Payouts started in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/z63prfzr6qt61.png?width=467&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faad3efe3a156c1f26e4adadefb20346466bb37e)  Understanding the nature of modern-day cloud computing and its future direction will allow investors to understand the paths that Roblox will take. The fundamental theory of this economy is that a customer's data is an increasingly tangible asset. The way that I like to examine the economic output of this industry is by two core economic elements.  1. The value of work generated by machine-to-machine transactions (network output).  2. The value of data and services generated by human experiences (customer input).   [Serverless computing - network service architecture for real-time and powerful apps.](https://preview.redd.it/wl88yq547qt61.png?width=1376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=618f6be99e0b7cc157065b4505cb82d7f89d5e36)  There are many organizations that capture the essence of this industry. Organizations like Square and Zoom will provide services that we're all familiar with, but we often forget the under-hood-details that exist and govern the infrastructure of these companies. What cloud computing organizations have realized is that as our engagement with platforms increases, the value of our data and needs becomes increasingly tangible. Our needs for financial technology or property rentals have resulted in regulatory or social challenges, which we typically refer to as "disruption". The disruption is rooted in the fact that our data is an authentically tangible good.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/vpzpov6deqt61.png?width=845&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0128b3dd2ee4912161dbfc99c9d312b8f57f9b6c  &amp;#x200B;  This idea that our data and time spent on digital platforms is the central hypothesis behind creation of the robux system that Roblox lives on. There are many things that Roblox needs to accomplish in the near to short term to achieve long-term profitability and the leadership seems to have a clear vision on how to achieve that:  1. The company will continue to redistribute its wealth back toward its developers.  2. The company will aggressively invest in education sectors to incentivize students to learn valuable skills.  3. The company will support wildly successful games as a way to create a long-term identity for Roblox (like popular Nintendo games)  4. The company will continue to invest in its cloud platform and eventually develop its own hardware platform to reduce its expenses.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/jr21jf1b8qt61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8175cc302d2be55fe0e446f0b78dc71d6f1d4956  The reason that I'm certain of this is because the organization needs to accomplish the following incentives and financial feats:  1. Reached a large enough audience in order to maintain long-term relevancy.  2. Produced and support games that create enough incentive to join the platform.  3. Created enough incentives for developers to produce quality experiences.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;"Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and website. Users can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox   &gt;   &gt;Premium. Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content. Developers can also earn Robux by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer’s experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user’s monthly subscription fee. Engagement-based payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences. Roblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the real-world currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program."  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/h95ts6pt8qt61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0406e17772f8f302bfdc4beb4eee288509e07440  In my view, Roblox's 2020 premium payout system will be one the biggest shifts in media as it has many potential outcomes that we aren't fully implemented yet. This is the nature of certain powerful architectures like computing more data at the edge or leaning on services like Fastly, Amazon Fargate, or other serverless/back-end platforms. Roblox is no such stranger to this and I would say that they certaintly have a vested interest in pushing these kinds of interactions.  Some uses cases of engagement-based payouts are repeatable to other platforms, where organizations like Reddit could easily implement similar financial logic if they discover that Reddit Subscribers spend the majority of their time to a small concentration of subreddits. This already exists to an extent, where users represent engagement through coin-sharing and reddit emoji placements.  Another example, if a high-quality education game were to be released on Roblox, where the developer agrees to redistribute their earned Robux to schools in need, then Roblox has achieved an economy where a student who is spending time learning has resulted in the improvement or construction of other learning facilities. This is also reflective of the idea that data is increasingly tangible.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/bb9j3yj7aqt61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8308e21dd05757fa74928a26560f665d0d61bf12  The possibilities with an engagement-based payout system are enormous for Roblox and produces added value to the ideas behind things like virtual concerts, streams, or other experiences that aren't fully realized in the gaming sector. For example, what is the economic consequence of children having a safe environment to attend concerts of their favorite artists? At the same time, the Robux payout system is a non-trivial distance away from creating applications of other alternative currencies like exchanging Robux with other digital assets like VBucks, tickets, or block-you-know-what-based applications.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/1g33ivkwaqt61.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6ff4e2b37801f0ee02fa70d46b8fa636bc5455b  Another core element to Roblox's financial future is to ultimately secure its means of distribution. As it currently stands, the biggest expense to the Roblox platform is the fee processing it must agree to when it comes to doing business with organizations like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other payment processors like Visa and Paypal. One way to reduce these costs and increase profitability is to develop products akin to the Nintendo Switch or Oculus platform. This idea is not too far away given the nature of Roblox's business, which has an enormous amount of various types of games that would be well-suited by Roblox partnerships. Overtime, the value of Apple or Google's distribution power weakens as the company cements itself into public consciousness.  &amp;#x200B;  The company has alluded to this idea with an April fool's joke in 2019, with a console known as the imagination-powered Robox:  &gt;" At Roblox, we’re continuously exploring new and innovative ways to bring our platform to millions of people across the world. Just as we’ve expanded onto phones, tablets, the Xbox One, and virtual reality, we believe that there’s an even greater potential just waiting to be unlocked.

Gaming is arguably the best form of media in the attention-economy where Roblox identifies itself at the intersection of education and digital media development.     A significant portion of the education sector is focused on STEAM pedagogy which aligned with and supported by Roblox goals long-term. Roblox is able to leverage cloud computing to disrupt traditional models in gaming, education, financial technology, and imagination markets.  &amp;#x200B;  Cover: [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdytQnMWkAM4SbN.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdytQnMWkAM4SbN.jpg)"

I bet you saw the price action in $CLOV yesterday (+20%)? Turns out the shorts got greedy again -- close to 120% greedy.  What??? Haven't they learnt their lesson with $GME at once? Apparently not. The $GME squeeze has cost a bunch of hedge funds (Melvin, Maplelane, D1) billions in losses on top of their damaged reputation and 'prestige'.  These hedge funds hold a lot of grudge towards a few people that chipped in during the $GME squeeze of January 2021 -- namely Chamath. See excerpt from Greenlight Capital (David Einhorn's hedge fund) letter:  [Einhorn's April 15 letter to investors](https://preview.redd.it/f54gnkshapt61.png?width=1254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f408458520ba063250597ad9c2e270e73eddfb75)  Their weapon of choice -- shorting $CLOV, which was SPACed by Chamath.  Isn’t $CLOV a pos stock? No, and even if it is, this is irrelevant. As you already figured it out, most short squeezes are mostly math. I think this will unfold whether or not we take part in it.  **$CLOV Short Interest:**  $CLOV has 118% short interest. Shorts will try an tell you that this is much lower. In fact that's exactly what Hindenburg tried to do today. Hindenburg even e-mailed FactSet to try an counter S3 Partners data (although their calculation also seems to be incorrect).

This is boneheaded at best and intentionally deceitful at worst:  * The CEO (Vivek Garipalli) is the founder of $CLOV; the likelihood of him selling his shares is close to nil * All his shares are Class B (10-to-1 voting ratio vs. Class A; only Class A shares are traded on the open market -- so they shouldn't be in the calculation in the first place), which means that if he sells or transfers his shares this will generally result in those shares converting to Class A (i.e. losing the supervoting feature) * Even if he would decide to sell, the shares are still locked-up until July * Management incentive plan is anchored at $30 per share. What this means is that the share price has to exceed $30 for 90 consecutive days in order for management plan RSUs to vest and be possible to sell  ***What does this mean?***  What this means is that a very small amount of $CLOV shares are free to trade because \~78% of the shares are still owned by insiders, locked-up and not trading. It only takes a little bit of gamma juice to make $CLOV move A LOT.  **Timing:**  Timing this is tricky. $CLOV is due to announce results on May 20th, so save for any other good news, this would be our catalyst.  To capture the biggest upside, the highest strike call options are the best for this. Currently the only May expiry options are 5/21 $30C (still cheap at $0.2). There is A LOT of calls OI for that date.  Inducing some gamma juice so that MMs have to hedge with more shares, making the shorts cover, increasing the Delta of our call options further, would help getting there and beyond.  Remember $CLOV ATH was $17.45 -- even if ALL shorts opened positions at that level, they would be 70% underwater if it hits $30. If you add leverage (all hedge funds are levered), say 2x -- they would be looking at a forced cover / liquidation à la Archegos.

Since the announcement there's been radio silence. Despite this, Discord was recently in the news again for banning NSFW servers from IOS. This could mean two things; A, Discord is scared of Apple taking notice and being banned from the appstore as a result of the ongoing lawsuit (Apple v Epic Games); B, Microsoft's top dogs are combing through every negative aspect that needs fixing before acquisition. I believe the ladder as Discord is definitely looking to get money ASAP but hasn't announced anything. In my opinion it'd be worth while to buy MSFT. It'd also might be worth while to hold on to the stock a bit longer while Microsoft would move Discord's server hosting to MS Azure hence strengthening their own platform. Take this with a grain of salt though as I'm in high-school and haven't invested in stocks."

The feeling of wanting to puke in every trashcan you walk by mixed with the just-above-ground-floating-weightlessness of an empty portfolio. It was something akin to a cactus whose skin people drink in a jungle I was once in.  Truly my spirit is no longer burdened by excessive wealth. Was it even mine though.. Zen masters believe you reincarnate through every door you walk through, Someone real sensitive said "May we always just begin to see our selves as something else and smile"  **Some of you, well let me correct myself, many of you will know this feeling.**  The brief apparition of gold that appears in the middle of a trade which does not deter you from continuing some sort of mad ascension, pressing the gas pedal to the floor as you rocket into Valhalla as fast as you smash out.

Life is too short to be a bitch and chicks dig scars.  **The specific details are a blur.**  GOEV is a fast bitch.  She's got a lot to offer just not now.  What tony has in his hat will take probably months to percolate... Shorts are in control and will be now that retail has been absolutely beaten up.  They will probably bail in some shape or form one of the first chances they get.  **There will always be a core group of supporters which I am one of.**  News will be released soon and I would say that its going to be on a scale of -10 which is Lawsuits have traction to 10 which is Apple Car.  Factory and manufacturing partner with some pre-orders is probably a 5-7 depending... You're going to need an 8+ to kick off a naughty squeeze... Or someone will have to take on the unified shorts in the sector. The big move will be convincing institutions to buy in and catch the paper hands of the bailing retail.  Canoo must have a better ground game.

There are class a and class b shares. Only 145 million shares are outstanding. The other shares are locked. The float is something between 110 million (yahoo) and 144 million (bloomberg). What happened? To calculate the short interest they reduced the float by the 83 million owned by the CEO. This leads to a new float of 26 million. This is the float the media is referencing. Only the CEO shares are already included in the 255 million shares, that are locked. The real float still is between 110 and 144 million. So with 39 million shares shortet, the short interest is really between 27 and 36 %.  The volume today was 244 million and the short volume 89 million (fintel) This would also be very hard to reach with a float of 26 million.  I think this is huge. People bought because of this data or closed their short positions.  Please excuse my bad English, I'm not a native speaker.

There's 3 key things that make me super bullish about it, and I'm gonna try to break them down without any of that technical jargon that you need to be actually smart to understand. Disney+, Disney Parks, and their merchandise.  So! let's start with the easiest one to dive into:  # THE THEME PARKS:    In 2019, Disney parks generated 6.7 BILLIONS in income, a little over 40% of their entire revenue.  With the pandemic, park attendance obviously plummeted, and several closed.  At the time of writing this, only 3 of the 6 parks globally are open, with one (Disney California) set to re open by the end of the month with reduced capacity (around 25% of the max).  With Biden's plan to have everyone able to be vaccinated soon, that capacity is going to back up to max, and as the entire world recovers the other parks go back to normal too.  with every park going back up, there's gonna be a massive bump in income.  That's before you consider that most everyone has been locked up for over a year now, and I am willing to bet my left nut that somewhere some little timmy and billy have been begging their middle class mommy and daddy to go to Disney.  I wouldn't be surprised if we see record attendance numbers for these parks this year.      But wait, there's more! There is an Avengers themed area set to open in June this year, and Galaxy's Edge, the Star Wars themed section of the American Parks, opened May 31, 2019  to  rave reviews!  Given the new Star Wars content being announced and published, attractions like these are going to continue to expand and draw people with new experiences.  You can build your own lightsaber there, for $200! and that ties into...     # THE MERCHANDISE:  Disney sells a LOT of shit.  I mean, a fucking lot.  Star Wars alone has entire series of novels, comic books, video games, apparel, and even a convention (Star Wars Celebration) .  And since the Sequel trilogy has ended, Disney has moved Star Wars into a new era: The High Republic.  Primarily as books and comics, this era is 200 years before the mainline series.  They have CENTURIES of timeline to play with, and without the restraints of existing material to confine them.  The Clone Wars is only a roughly 3 year period in the lore, and the amount of shit that happens in that period is insane.  Disney is going to milk this period for as much as they can, with some speculation they may bring in some fan favorite characters from Star Wars Legends (canon before Disney bought the rights and erased 90% of the timeline), namely Darth Revan.  I won't get into it too much, but Revan alone is a huge draw for Star Wars Fanatics.  Marvel is also killing it with comic books and collectibles, but my knowledge is admittedly less in depth on the MCU stuff, merch wise.  The universe, though?  &amp;#x200B;  # DISNEY+:  Disney+ is an absolute gold mine that Disney is sitting on.  They have exclusive access to two of the biggest IP's, period, with Star Wars and the MCU, and both are built on movies and tv shows.  With how the Netflix MCU shows have had the rights revoked, the onslaught of new shows (Wandavision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Clone Wars season 7, Bad Batch, The Mandalorian, Book of Boba Fett, Kenobi...) Disney is setting itself up to keep those subscriber numbers up by slow feeding the horde of fans with content.  Add in how they've been doing movie releases on the platform with Mulan, where you paid an additional $30 to access the brand new movie, and how that model has also been confirmed for the upcoming Black Widow and Cruella films, and it's a safe assumption that Disney is gearing the platform up to be a theatre alternative.  why go buy a movie ticket and drive to theater, deal with a noisy crowd, and not be able to pause the movie when you can just buy it from home and watch it? This is likely going to happen for the entire future of the MCU.  The big ace up the sleeve though, is the Fox library.  Remember that Disney bought out Fox not too long ago? They have nearly all Fox content now on Disney+.  X-men, Avatar (blue aliens, not the cartoon) Night at the Museum, etc are all Disney now.      In short, Disney is STACKED to make a killing these next few years, but especially this year."

TuSimple said it will expand its service area with existing customers UPS and McLane. U.S. Xpress is a new partner. Penske will help TuSimple scale its fleet of operations nationwide and provide preventative maintenance for the self-driving trucks, the company said.  TuSimple said the network will be rolled out in three phases, starting with a focus on a service area in the Southwest where it already operates. Phase 1, which will launch in 2020 and into 2021, will cover service between Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.  This fall, TuSimple plans to open a new shipping terminal in Dallas. TuSimple said these terminals are designed to be shared by mid-sized customers. TuSimple will carry freight directly to a company’s distribution center if it is a high-volume customer.  The second phase will begin in 2022 and expand service from Los Angeles to Jacksonville and connect the East Coast with the West, the company said.  The final phase will expand across the lower 48 states, beginning in 2023. The company said it will replicate the strategy in Europe and Asia after the AFN rolls out nationwide.

The company posted revenue of $1.8 million last year and a net loss of $177.9 million, according to the filing, reflecting how it is still in the early stages of developing commercial technology.

ms9tyd,1618599124,VonDerBerg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ms9tyd/chpt_reloaded_dd/,"$CHPT Reloaded DD"," Position: 576@26.02  **DESCRIPTION**  Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops &amp; manufactures hardware &amp; software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, &amp; services for corporate, public, &amp; residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.  **History**  In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.  The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;  **What is the business model of CHPT?**  Charge Point sells hardware &amp; software (equipment &amp; network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.  **BUSINESS OVERVIEW**  * Market Cap: \~$7bn * Shares Float 299mln * Institutional ownership \~13% * 2 Year CAGR Revenue Growth 65.65%; 5 Year 60%; * TAM $190bn * Newly formed entity has no Debt. Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents \~$650m. * Exponential Revenue growth &amp; estimated profitability in 2024 with 41% Gross Margin.  Source:[https://switchback-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChargePoint-New-Investor-Deck-23-Sept-2020-8K.pdf](https://switchback-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChargePoint-New-Investor-Deck-23-Sept-2020-8K.pdf)  📷  $CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are "non-networked", carving \~53% market share of "networked" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 &amp; L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.  **Products**  Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding  **Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks  **Challengers**  * $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better "engagement" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s &amp; 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*. * SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential). * $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus. * $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*"The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period."* * $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.  **Near Term Catalysts**  In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: "AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone."  It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.  That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.  **Long Term Catalysts**  \- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.  $CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.  **Miscellaneous**  $CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.  $CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.  $CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.  In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.  No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.  Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.  **MOAT**  * First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go) * Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance &amp; responsibilities to the owner) * Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity) * Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share &amp; operations in 14 countries)  **CONCLUSION**  All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.  **Why am I interested in $CHPT?**  Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.  Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home "GAS station".  Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.  A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.  This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals &amp; \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.  Average target price $38.21"

There doesn’t seem to be any reason for it, demand is increasing, production is steady, inventory is dropping, and economic data has been increasingly positive, with Covid downturns in Europe already priced in, and the US/travel beginning to open up.  While there are undoubtedly risks to oil itself dropping such as the OPEC+ production increases slated for may, it doesn’t make sense why oil prices would increase while oil stocks, which are almost solely dependent on oil prices, drop.   I believe this coming week will see one of two weeks, a correction of crude oil prices themselves, or a massive gap up in oil stock prices.  A massive gap up to me makes more sense, as until may there are not many major sources of strife outside of a massive covid spike or rapid production increases from Russia/Iran (which is definitely possible but I don’t believe likely)  It seems that the prices may be pushed down in order to create a panic sell slide which would allow a better entry for larger positions for institutional investors.   I’ve also seen several “prepaid forward contracts” vehicles that went into effect this week from Citigroup and UBS listing MRO as one of the underlying stocks, I’m wondering if they are driving prices down to hedge their bets so they could be in a better position when the interest payments for these contracts come around. Using the initial funds generated by the contracts to purchase cheaper shares and simply pay out comparatively smaller interest on them to their customers. They make money from the purchase of these forward contracts initially, and they make more from the purchase of cheaper shares that they are pocketing, rather than those who purchase the contracts.  For reference the Citigroup contract has three underlying assets: MRO, WYNN, and BA. All of which have dropped 1.5% or more this week despite better outlooks economically.   The Citigroup filing is below, this is obviously all speculative, and I’m not trying to sound conspiratorial, but I truly don’t know what else it could be, what do you think?

Let me start with I am not a financial adviser, I am just a lowly engineer who likes numbers.  **MRNA**  Projected sales for 2021 $18 billion (from MRNA last Quarter)  Projected does sold in 2021 600 million to 1 billion  Price per dose $32-$38 per dose depending on how many you buy.  Just using these numbers MRNA will gross $19 billon to $38 billion.  This gives us an EPS of $46-$96.  At its current price the P/E ratio would only be 1.5-3.5!!  I know I am not figuring in costs but they cant be that bad.  I would guess $2-3 billion to ramp up production?  Moderna reports earnings on the 5th of May, I expect this to be a total blowout from what I can see above.    So why is the price so low still?  I am guessing that the fear of something going wrong with the vaccine  is still priced in.  If something goes wrong it would be catastrophic but so far so good!  I have yet to see any zombie reports...      **Why I am investing heavily in MRNA:**  \-I believe in the company.  I am double vaccinated with Moderna and everyone I know that had it had very mild side effects.  \-I believe in the science of what they are doing with messenger RNA.    \-Booster shot sales in the future?

Over the past few years and more interestingly few months we're seeing a staggering increase in legalization of recreational cannabis in the united states at the state level.  More importantly keeping a close eye on the activity of the Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer there is a continuous promise of reform legislation being introduced "soon". Soon is a dangerous word and this is an invitation to time the market.  Normally don't ever try to time the market like this. I'm a big believer in leaps on principle. From a few key data points being vast increase in legalization legislation at the state level and the echoes from Schumer's twitter feed about the very soon incoming reform legislation I'm finally ready to make my bet.  If you've kept up on the posts of my sub(I will not mention the name of my sub because that's not the point. I just needed a place where I knew my posts would NOT BE REMOVED.) you'll see I'm pretty consistent about watching Schumer's moves and also the new state legislation. All the news is good news. I want to cover one data point that I haven't really mentioned in the past. Schumer in 2018 introduced the MORE act. It obviously didn't go anywhere with McConnel running the senate but this is a very different situation. It is my firm belief that Schumer will actually do what he says he's going to do. The interesting data point about MORE act in 2018 was that it was introduced on the most meme date: April 20th.  I think Schumer is going to be apart of the meme and reintroduce legislation on this day next week. I also expect to see more robust edition of the legislation that handles many of the concerns of both the right and the left with regards to gracefully transitioning to a legal cannabis market.  Schumer Wyden and Booker worked together to build something so I am concluding that it's extensive, robust and addresses concerns around the war on drugs and the effects on POC in the United States.  There are some concerns around risk of the vote passing and avoiding it going nowhere due to filibuster. After doing research on the senators on the right wing and also watching unexpected support for the SAFE act I am now convinced that the legislation will be passed in the Senate this year.  I have covered every concern I've had about cannabis in my past posts be it on my sub largely or on r/wallstreetbets. If you want to see some of my DD go look for it. I'm not cross posting or linking them.  # My Expectations  I expect the announcement on the 20th next week and a sharp price movement upward. The following day there may be a selloff as there are always scalpers to shake out the FOMO buyers. I expect the price to either stagnate or slowly rise until the legislation ultimately pass and then a sharp selloff of 10-20%. This will be the day traders / short term traders exiting for profit.  I think it's fair to expect at least a 25% increase in the price of MSOs and relevant ETFs that carry those holdings. (MSOS and some yolo holdings). Yes I'm speculating and no that isn't a math-derived number. MSOS currently sits at $40. It has taken hits over the past few months as pretty much the whole market.  I think the whole sector will jump but ultimately non multi state operators will see a brutal selloff depending on what's in the bill. My expectation with the legislation is that MSOs and smaller competitors will be the greatest beneficiaries. POC and people who want to enter the sector on a small retail end will be considered in the bill as they historically were a target of the war on drugs and will likely see special consideration in the bill.  Why?  Licensing isn't going away. This bill will not make a 'wild-west' scenario where anyone can enter the market. Licenses aren't free and aren't unlimited. Each state will control who has a license to interact in the sector. This isn't new and I'd be completely shocked to see any reversal of this trend. More so the states are ultimately going to be in control of all of the rules give or take a few federal stipulations.  # My Bet  If you've followed my posts you'll see I'm already very long on MSOS and the industry as a whole. I will get calls for either May or June and hold them for a bit. I will before the final vote is taken get some puts. I expect the sell off so I expect to ride it up by entering calls before announcement of the legislation and getting puts before the vote as I expect a selloff. This will also help me insulate my self from some of the risk of holding a completely one sided position.  I simply don't have enough money to exercise all of the calls I can buy so I will be selling a large portion of the short term ones after announcement. The strike on my long calls will be around c50 or c55.  # In short my play  * Buy calls before week ending 4/16 (expiry either May or June depending on risk and price) * Sell calls after 4/20 * Buy puts before the final vote is taken in congress * Close puts after vote confirms legalization * Buy shares with any profits I've made  Here's my current positions as I don't know exactly when I'll enter my new calls. obviously I'm doing it today.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/vh5s8f1ldkt61.png?width=829&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f5feafefb393f2def873ad66e5bb1b339e49cd3  # TLDR: MSOS 4/20 🚀🚀"

Furthermore, WSB took important place in my life recently, so I decided to give back to the community, creating this comprehensive memeful ape-friendly GME DD 💎🙌🚀🌕🪐🌌","In the process of researching GME I was able to accumulate the material into this ape-friendly long read, largely aimed at newcomers of the sub. Though, this giant brain candy can and should be enjoyed by anybody!   I have to warn you, apester, this is a super duper long read and it will take a considerable amount of your time as well as about 140% (several estimations state that the percentage might even be as high as 420-696.9%) of brain resources. However, it is completely worth it to read it in full, I promise you - ap~~e~~ transcendence is imminent upon completing the reading. Also, do it for the love to memes, because I genuinely handcrafted about 15 memes and put it here for your satisfaction.  My fundamental idea behind this colossal, voluminous piece of work was to build a framework for myself (and other interested apes), as to be aware of where it all stands now, how it all got here, and the likely outcomes of this spectacular show you have all been observing and participating in. Furthermore, I tried my best to make the language as simple as possible, using **ELIA**s (**E**explain **L**ike **I**'m an **A**pe) where possible, and doing my best in elaborating on difficult financial concepts and terms for this intellectually limited individuals with extraordinary small brain capacity that you all are. This work is structured in such a way so that even with zero knowledge in the subject, you will be able to grasp all of the important concepts from the first go. It is especially important for the newcomers of this sub, influx of whom might happen, should any major potential catalyst unwhale. So, do not hesitate to share this even with 1/10 brain-wrinkled individuums. I believe in your mental capabilities apemeisters (though, I know that at this point it is a pure gamble - and I am in the right place for that).  And yeah, this a not a financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Just and ape with one and a half brain wrinkles (hopefully).  **LR; TD (Long Read; To Do) by Master Yoda:**  https://preview.redd.it/nz4ujbu2ujt61.png?width=487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e45b0bcd43bd5b0247f413b1978e7e246801c41  The story addressed is as old as this world, and it involves greed, manipulation, exploitation, corruption and decay; as well as unity, bravery (abreast retardation), optimism, support and and creative forces. The eternal battle of good and evil, no matter how corny it sounds. Compulsory buckle up and eat a crayon apefriend, that's going to be a ride!  # Chapter I. The Short, the Squeeze and the Ugly  The story begins with a hedge fund (HF from here on), and there is really nothing particular about this HF. For general understanding of an ape that knows nothing: "A **hedge** **fund** is an investment partnership - the marriage of a fund manager and investors who pool their money together into the fund, with the objective of earning active return." - The **game** is that simple, thanks, Inve **stop** edia, you are always spot on! The HF might have been named by whichever name exists, it really does not matter for history. What is actually important, is the setting in which it operated, and the rules, according to which this HF played (and also exploited). In this particular case, the antagonist is called Melvin Capital Management LP (MC thereafter). However, I would encourage you not to get attached to names; but instead view the antagonist as a collective image, as an intrusive parasite, which appears as soon as a suitable environment exists for that. And where there is one parasite, there will come many.  &amp;#x200B;  **"ButT wat did di Hedgehogs do so that ther is sO mutch indiEgnation boUt t?"**  You are asking the right questions here, my little ape-man fellow. Only the lazy haven't scolded the HF, and as a matter of fact there are solid grounds to do so. Briefly, the antagonists exploited the loophole (do not confuse with the loop hole in your head, apemeister) in the short selling mechanism, which effectively allowed them to severely manipulate the market for their benefit. Furthermore, the bad guys have been doing that for years and even decades. GME is a very indicative, even whistleblowing example of the wrongdoing being done. All of these issues will be **D**ug **D**eeper into and discussed in detail further on, but let me start from the basics for half-wrinkled beginner apes to catch up with us, one whole wrinkle elitists.  **SHORT SELLING ELIA.** You are a smart entrepreneurial ape, and you obtained the information that led you to believe that the banana market will be aplenty this year (banana harvest go BBBRRRRR) and as a result the prices will drop significantly. The ape progress is so advanced, that you are able to enter a contractual relationship with another apedividual. This guy is known to have a big bulk of bananas just laying around, so you use this opportunity to borrow those for a period of time and agree to give those back later with the premium. The other ape sees you as a credible partner (understandable, as you went to Apeuke University and received MBA there - Master of Banana Appreciation degree)  thus lending you 100 bananas for one ape dollar each. You then rush to the local ape banana market 'ooh ooh ahh ahh'-ing all the way in great cheer for what a businessape apemomma raised. You sell the goods for $100 and wait. Because your due diligence was apegod-tier, the plan worked and one banana now costs 0.5 ape dollars. You then buy 100 banananas back from the market for $50 and give it back to the apelender, as well as a small premium agreed upon previously. ???? **PROFIT!!!!** (of about 50 bucks)  https://preview.redd.it/x0hwq95cujt61.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=353e830d77c215761c0b595610eac2e2e98a9c65  However, the example above only illustrates the perfect world, where all apes are honest apes and the ape market does not have inefficiencies. The current problem with short selling is that at one moment GME had the highest percentage of float shorted in the world, amounting to about 140% (and by many it is considered to be a rookie number, even currently). Yes, it does mean that more shares were sold short than shares existed. It is a big issue, let's discuss it in detail. One important point before we dive deeper, though. Lately I saw many honorable 'traders' ( ' ' marks mean that the word is used as an anagram) in comments criticizing the short mechanism as a whole, viewing it negatively and in some extreme examples even advocating the prohibition of it. And even though,  https://preview.redd.it/xt8bt34hujt61.png?width=488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6506e88f0d417c5c62cde5ba20cd2c7ac39b170  , at this point it is important to mention that short selling is an integral part of the markets for a variety of reasons. In addition to creating liquidity to help make a market, short selling allows people to benefit from a stock price going down (as explained in the bananas ELIA above) leveling the playing field for those looking to make all types of investments. Short selling is an essential component of market stability (as long as it is not exploited, surely): hence sometimes longs are blinded by euphoria and optimism and there’s no one to hold these companies' feet to the fire, short sellers look at companies with a bit more of a critical eye than the average investor. Ooh, I'm starting to sound like a 🌈🐻, so forgive me permabullapes, as I have sinned, forgetting and ignoring the only autistic postulate to live by here, and that is: "STONKS ONLY GO UP".  &amp;#x200B;  **"k Shortz IMPOrTENT but hoW iZ 140% bananana sell? Ape iNfinit maniy go BrrrRrr?"**  Yeah, you caught it right, smoothie-brainie. The main components to that are so-called IOUs, settlement cycles, leverage, excessive borrowing, failures to deliver, and, most importantly:  https://preview.redd.it/rgbvoyrlujt61.png?width=488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00239d43b35be1f158734b19e14fedb4be05bcf2  I am sorry that your head exploded after looking at the words aforementioned above, I really am! But this is how the evolution works, and you just fell victim to it. Nevermind, just collect the shattered pieces of your brain (about two grams, should not take long), put it back into the empty vessel that your head is, and fix it with some duct tape, I dunno. Jokes aside, let's continue, and now I will explain the cornerstone concepts of IOU obligations (abbreviation of I Owe You) as well as FTDs (failures to deliver), as these will be prevalent through the entire discussion. Starting from the basics first:  **IOUs ELIA**. Your ape grandma lived a busy life and she has a lot of ape-dollars as her savings. She heard about the banana price increase hype as everyone's been talking about it, so she decided to buy some for her own. Luckily, there is a decent broker called Bananality, and because she feels like really shaking the old days, she YOLOs all her savings into the bananas of BanaNonStop Corp. So far so good? 🐻 with me. As soon as apema pays for the banana stock, the money and the bananas have to change hands, and this is called 'settlement'. In many ape countries money and bananas change hands two days after the trade, and that is called 'T+2'. Ideally, this processes have to take place simultaneously. But in the current ape financial system bananas are divorced from money, thus her money may settle independently of  bananas settlement. Before the trade settles, ape grandma will be holding banana IOUs on her account, and importantly these are IOUs for BANANAS, not for money. Furthermore, the system sees her IOUs as normal stock bananas. In the perfect ape world, the blockage does clear up after T+2, and Bananality is able to send the banana stock through the system hence the IOUs are wiped out.  **Failures to Deliver (FTDs) ELIA**. Now let's imagine that apema was not so lucky in choosing her broker and ran into a crook, who wants to deliberately exploit the system of settlement and the broker is called Bananaked. The grandma enters the trade, the money settles, however, something blocks Bananaked from settling its shares through the system. And this something is nothing but a malicious intent, as all the the broker did was issuing banana IOU's with no real intention of covering it according to the rules. It might even be the case, that Bananaked never held those shares which he sold. If at the moment of T+2 settlement the IOUs are not covered by the banana stocks, it creates a deliberate, strategic failure to deliver. FTDs will be involved in the discussion later on, as these are the main vehicles through which the loophole is exploited (still, not as bad as your hole is exploited, though). Well, fuck you, Bananaked, the day will come and you will be dealt with for messing up with apema, mark my ape word!  &amp;#x200B;  **"My brraIn hurtz caN i go home PleZ?"**  Puts on your brain then. Just eat a banana, or a Crayon, you will be fine... Allrighty, you convinced me. Lets dive out of theory and discuss GAMEEESTOOOOP, finally! We will jump back to the concepts elaborated upon above as soon as the context is necessary for that. Here, Wen Moon got your back and he will cheer you up for your dedication to reading!  [\\"Camon ape ya can do it, read and evolve!\\" - Wen Moon.](https://preview.redd.it/cboe9744vjt61.jpg?width=1059&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cffb0db75e9a238bd26bb7d36b2b78b509be34ec)  &amp;#x200B;  **"oKay i candO yit, fUkc mah braIn wit moore nowledge mtfakeRr!"** \- an ape.  That's the approach I needed. Remember about antagonistic MC? No, not the one who performed at your ape party last weekend and did it pretty bad. I'm talking about Melvin Capital. So, the main story line begins in 2014, the year when MC started to short the stock that I like very, very much. Gabe Plotkin, MC manager stated that fact proudly himself, during the first Congressional Hearing. There were several big fundamental reasons to bet on GME decline at that time, among which: company's debts and financial position, digitalization of the gaming industry, consoles sales \[big part of the revenue\] super-cycle moving away from its apex (and later on, the pandemic happened, which added dramatically to the negative sentiment). Let's take a look at the chart of GME:  [GME Monthly Chart, 2014-2019 highlighted](https://preview.redd.it/fr7lat7kvjt61.png?width=2129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b93e9ba2885b5093a8687aa249fdb2dce0bc5676)  As you may see, the chart covers a relatively long period of time, and the big red REKTangle here highlights the fat and nasty, steady downward trend. From the current outlook on things, it is obvious that MC made a correct financial decision, shorting the stock from its highs of about $45 a share, all the way down to about 3-6 dollars per share diapason starting in the middle of 2019. That is a whooping gain of more than ninety(90)!!! %, or more than forty dollars per share gain! Impressive numbers, aren't they? Yeah, you won: you were right betting against the company; you've made shit tons of money; your wife's boyfriend accepted your dominance as an alpha 'trader' (anagram) ape and voluntarily left the family, now FIX YOUR FUCKING PROFITS AND CLOSE YOUR POSITION! Why did the shorters not cover when they had a perfect opportunity window for that LASTING FOR MORE THAN A FUCKING YEAR? Because of the bankruptcy jackpot.  As it was explained previously short selling is an important market instrument and it may deliver net decent profits for investors who thoroughly calibrate the risk; the 'bankruptcy jackpot' is a relatively uncommon situation which promises a much larger pay off should it occur. And it is an extremely risky bet, the one that only the epic 'traders' are willing to undertake (so, to some extent it is possible to say, that MC belongs to WSB). The HFs were driven by the fact, that in the event of insolvency, any collateral provided to back up the shorted shares has to be returned to the short seller. Furthermore, as it is no longer necessary to return the shares shorted, the shortist takes it all, the whole profit. As soon as the it became obvious for HFs that the copany should soon go buncrupt, the MHFs decided to 'help' Gamestop and invoked their dirty trick of naked short selling to the full power (the mechanism is discussed below). Before the Ryan Cohen updates, the consensus and the market sentiment on the greatest stock of all time was severely grim. So, why not go all in if you had already won it all (HF reasoning)?  They dared to YOLO, 140% or more type of YOLO...  https://preview.redd.it/8l0ujmtsvjt61.png?width=486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a2deb71b74665b5d5395a97249941d74570a9b1  And soon the shitshow of an unimaginable scale begins to uncover itself. But before that...  &amp;#x200B;  **"WatT hapenT nExt telL meh rn ya cheeKY wahnKerR!1? How dit dey YOYO?"**  Everything has its time, young padawan, don't hurry. The second half of 2020 brought several substantial catalysts for the dramatic shift of GME consensus towards being positive, accordingly, pushing the price of the stock to the upside. And to a great extent it has to be attributed to one fellow, and you all know his name. Yes, apeladies and gentleapes, this is your hero and savior, &lt;in Leeroy's Jenkins voice&gt; RYYYYYAAAAANN COOOOHEEEN. If by now you do not know this guy, then you can't really call yourself an ape, things don't work like that here, go and duckduckgo him or something!  By buying a big stake of GME \[12.91% currently\], RC (and his Ventures) brought a lot of attention to the company, giving the market sentiment a powerful bullish impulse, and then accelerating it even further by getting deeper involved into the business operation and the development of GameStop. At this point, it is fair to say, that many of the pioneering bulls were jumping into the market buying rumors.  [Many, but not u\/DeepFuckingValue of course. This guy is out of this world.](https://preview.redd.it/v7m84mkqwjt61.png?width=486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5bbbf5afcba1ec73751912ce860f7bc397ee640)  It is with the new updates that were being poured out of the bucket, the investors, ‘traders’ and general market participants found out that: GameStop is underway towards its digital transformation (online sales increased in 300% Q3 2020); internal restructuring bound to the new growth strategy, resulting in CFO replacement; new consoles supercycle starting with PS5 and XBox Series X/S releases (historically very strong periods for *GME*), and many, many more under the hood developments of which we are not even aware of, or only start to find out about (just type the word 'delivery' into the search of a friendly *sub*). To conclude on that point:  https://preview.redd.it/bm94jyf0xjt61.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ec245cad38eb6d05c47ee5d168e5e498c45840a  When a general market sentiment changes from negative to positive, it is usually a bad idea to bet against it. Even WSB 'traders' understand this fundamental principle (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is where you, honorable 'Trader' with capital later, started to outplay the 'Big Guys'. Literally, the  🌈🐻 HFs fell victim to their own relentless greed and stupidity, forgetting the golden trading rule that the trend is your friend until the end, and they did it spectacularly. Furthermore, instead of closing the positions and cutting the losses, they kept YOLOing and shorted more and more, in an attempt to suppress the buying pressure. And literally, now all that it takes you to show an awesome 'tradering' performance this year, is to buy, and hold.  &amp;#x200B;  **"Okeh ape undeErstant now GEEmeEe go BBRRRRR. How about shorts, though?"**  Dafaq, you are evolving ape, look at how you are able to communicate! That's one whole correctly structured question with no 'TrAdEratIon'. Keep it up! And yeah, what about shorts? Briefly:     # shortz r fuk  &amp;#x200B;  **Short Squeeze ELIA**. Finally, it is time to discuss the most juicy squeezey piece of the puzzle. Let's refer to the short selling ELIA now. Remember how the businessape from the first ELIA happily brought the bananas to the ape market and in anticipation of the prices falling, sold his borrowed banana stock. Now, imagine that the forecast was not justified, and the things went according to the worst scenario possible: the banana harvest was poor and these became scarce; having bananas is now fashionable, and every ape wants to put their hands on what's hot; poor harvest, but because of abundant sunlight the bananas left are very delicious, so apes are ready to fight for putting it in their mouths... and etc. The businessape rushes around, panicking, begging for bananas, but these are nowhere to be found, because apemeisters hodl precious with their diamond ape hands; or, are only willing to sell 1-2 bananas for a ridiculous price of 500.000-1.000.000 ape dollars. The businessape now understands how screwed he is. He also recalls that the ape-guy he borrowed bananas from is an apemafiozi with a very bad reputation, because of punishing his failed debtors by putting LARGE bananas into their ANALysis. Fiasco, isn't it? The businessape now has nothing left to do, but to buy the banans back with any price available. Fortunately, the fortune he earned through decades of successful business is sufficient for covering his debts. And if not, you better recapitalize, ape pal, before bananas play a cruel joke on your ANALysis.  Apemeister! Don't hesitate to pause the reading and eat a Crayon if you need to. I know, that's a lot to digest, so take a proper care of your brain, currently working on 69420% of its capacity. Ready? Finally, this is the part where everything discussed above converges to one point. Quick ape recap: market sentimet bad, GME shortz short go BBBRRRR, Ryan Cohen buys GME to make it likable, market sentiment good, shortz r fuk, GME go BBBRRRR.  **"shortz r lit, hOew can i yoYO my BandaNas ape wAnt SHArT seLl stuCk?**  https://preview.redd.it/h225sf29xjt61.png?width=484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c1f02665af002a608d56e21d1cbe4f2b0c98f82  Oh, I see you are coming back to your natural state of an ape 'trader' again. I started to worry about you evolving too fast, now we're back to normal. 🐻 with me, this is the most interesting part.  https://preview.redd.it/gnxvi3bgxjt61.png?width=487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86b3a89e5c245e5ba1a22fb09df4ac9cbb120dd7  Remember IOUs, FTDs, HFs' YOLO 140% SI? Pepperidge apes remember. Ok, so, basicly short interest is a number that indicates the proportion of the shares in circulation (also called a float) sold short. Based on the businessape example, it would mean that he borrowed 100 out of 100 bananas available to being borrowed, went to the ape market and sold 140 bananas. Dafaq? How is that even possible? This is a complicated process, which I aim to discuss with a very in-**D**epth **D**ive, but in a separate post, Chapter II (as this post is voluminous enough already), alongside with dark pools, payment for order flow, sales restrictions, and other fuckeries for that matter.  For now, take a look at the following, and refer back to IOUs and FTDs ELIAs if necessary. According to T+2 settelment, the share has to be setteled no letter than two working days after the trade has been made. Before the settlement, what you hold on your 'tradering' account is an obligation for this share that you just bought - IOU. On a properly functioning market and not being exploited, T+2 has its positive effects too, providing additional liquidity to the system. However, when we talk about short selling, its effects can be destructive. Particularly, the loophole is used as an instrument to leverage the short position, without providing the adequate collateral in the short selling process which has to be, well you guessed, a share! And this process is being made three times cheaper for big players, as market makers operate based on T+6 settlement rule. That is to say, T+X makes it possible to back up your short position and create additional, artificial selling pressure by using IOUs which, in the nature of this mechanism, work as counterfeit collateral, and in its essence being nothing but  https://preview.redd.it/05e17wklxjt61.png?width=485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b19d340a5a2d1f6ebd7af4da14cc9e953fad2ae  Furthermore, if you overuse or even overabuse this mechanism (to 140% and more), you may find yourself in a very unfortunate situation, similarly, to the one that MC and shorters found themselves in. Literally, by repeating this process over and over again, they put themselves into the trap, resulting in an inability to cover the excessive amount of shares borrowed, breeding FTDs in an futile attempt to fight the buying pressure. The key point to be made here is that it is often more profitable for big market participants to pay a fine, rather than letting the FTD game get loose, because the rules and laws in this area are not strict enough. Then, when nobody looks at the problem, well, the problem goes away. Сounterfeit IOUs morphing into FTDs allow shorters to manipulate the market by artificially decomposing the buying pressure, but as it is a double edged sword - there is a high chance that the accumulated compression will fucking blow in your face at the inevitable moment. Once, ONCE in the history of 'traderation', the 'BIG MONEY' YOLOd against you, respectable 'trader', and they fucking lost spectacularly. When it is obious for everybody that you lost, it is probably a good idea to cut your loses and close the positions. Can you see the beauty of their YOLO? It is almoast as good as GUH (if you don't know what it means, YT it urgently - GUH WSB!). The artificial selling pressure that is accumulating into a ticking atomic bomb is just crazy, and oh boy, would I not want to be on that side of the trade now, getting my ass torn apart by this blast, as soon as it is no longer possible to constrain it.  Furthermore, and most importantly, if they can use these pesky techniques now, how do you know that they did not use that in 2014, when the initail GME mega downtrand was born? With the media being used as a manipulation instrument currently, it might have also been used as a tool to formulate the negative outlook on Gamestop starting from 2014 too... That is just crazy and mindblowing, isn't it?  More than that, many new fuckeries were revealed: RobbingHood trade restrictions, cheating with ETF's and calls, short attacks, you know the list. This is utterly unfair, so the only available option for me in this delicate situation everybody found themselves in, was to buy and hold, because I like the stock. The end. Or is it?  **TL; DR:**  *Processing img fsbyxzcqxjt61...*  Meanwhile...     https://preview.redd.it/mozoqv1vxjt61.png?width=486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cf244ce363d9717bf50e707b5be7d0ddaafd801"

Let's see if we can't get you some of that money back, and enjoy some really bad CGI in the process instead.  This week, let's examine a company which, inexplicably, came out with a robot that can perform surgery 20 years before someone figured out how to automate the cashier at McDonald's (how's that for a checkmark for simulation theory?).  This week's examination is Intuitive Surgical ($ISRG).  &amp;#x200B;  # What do they do?  Well, the TL:DR is they help ensure that you have to wait longer before you can collect the inheritance and life insurance on your Boomer ass parents, because it helps keep them alive.  &amp;#x200B;  They're really more of a product than a company. (yeah, I know about the EndoWrist shit, but that's hardly a revenue generator)  They make the Da  Vinci robot surgeon that you see in hospitals so long as you live in a nicer, more gentrified part of town.  Or work for one of the Colombian drug cartels - those dudes have the best medics.  If you've never heard of it, it's basically a Swiss army knife of attachments that will cut your ass open, fix what it can (sorry, that extra chromosome has to stay), and stitch you back up, all while your surgeon deals with his raging hangover and wonders what happened after he blacked out to where his ass is really sore this morning and the security guard out in the parking lot can't stop smiling at him.  That's it.  That's all they do.  Blah blah blah proprietary software blah blah blah expensive maintenance contracts blah blah blah each attachment for the robot costs money so hopefully your hospital sprang for the clip applier attachment before they snipped that pulmonary vein.  Fingers crossed.       Also, it apparently makes pancakes. :  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  [Cause that's not creepy at all](https://preview.redd.it/kssh7h1mnht61.jpg?width=993&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c30426e1dd5fba779b9efdc7c524868f364120f2)  &amp;#x200B;  Which goes to show how outdated the tech has become, since everybody knows ebelskivers are superior.  # Deep dive:  This won't hurt a bit, except for the parts where it's excruciatingly bad.    &amp;#x200B;  $ISRG is a 95 billion dollar company that sells about 1200 ~~Treadwell Droids~~  surgical robots a year at 2 million dollars a pop, and has come up with a great scam where some of the attachments are disposable so you have to keep buying them.  God bless America.  They make about a billion a year licensing out their software for use to mitigate the fact that your doctor can't remember which cord goes into which hole, and another 700 million or so on maintenance contracts to reboot the things when they accidentally kill somebody.   They make about 4 billion dollars annually, give or take.  For a company that lives and dies by its R&amp;D, it surprisingly has no debt on the books.  It just makes more shares when they need money.   This also might have something to do with the fact that they haven't really improved on the thing in 20 years because nobody is forcing them to innovate.   They're trading near their ATH, at 804.72 as of the time of this writing.   The biggest fundamental thing to note about this company is that they basically have no competitors.  There is a company out there called Asensus Surgical that made a run at the king, but fell so short that they changed their name from TransEnterix Surgical.  It's not that their robot - the Senhance - was bad, per se, it was just that it turned out it was only good for laparoscopics, which is fairly niche.  For the record, I like that company, but we can't talk about them here.  &amp;#x200B;  One thing I've always hated about this company but have held my nose and overlooked was that it's PB ratio is way out of whack for its space.  The average company in the medical equipment industry averages about 5.1 PB.  $ISRG sits at 9.7.  Their PEG also sits at 6.5, which is fucking crazy.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  # Cool.  So how much growth for buying in to the fucking robot army?  &amp;#x200B;  Actually....none.  They made 2.64 a share a year ago, but the whispers on the street - and by street, I mean company executives - are to expect a down quarter this time around due to a combination of less hospital revenue as a result of leaving so much open bed space for the spicy flu and lower demand for elective surgical procedures - and, of course, by lower demand, I mean people being told they can't have them because there's a risk of catching a bug that you'll probably never even know you caught.  $ISRG had been rising recently on the ASSUMPTION that hospitals were going to open back up to more high margin things like elective procedures and away from things like "leaving half the hospital empty in case 3 people catch the 'Rona".  However, through the 1st quarter of the year, that has not happened, which means the backlog of surgical procedures just continues to grow.  ASC's (ambulatory surgery centers) throughout a good chunk of the country still haven't converted away from triage facilities yet or are closing down surgical theatres periodically to reallocate staff, and there's no real word on when that is going to get rectified.  &amp;#x200B;  Analysts have already been adjusting their expectations for the quarter downwards in the last month.  Expectations are now a 4% drop in earnings on flat-to-slightly-up overall revenues.  $ISRG has a habit of beating on earnings pretty much always, but they've reached such a lofty valuation that swapping out Tyson Fury for a Tyson chicken and then bragging you kicked its ass probably isn't going to be that impressive.    &amp;#x200B;  # Wait...so why should I buy it?  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/cge9cbc1qjt61.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f03e91b88baedbe72bfbee8b1e3ddc6fcc9a8ec  Plot twist:  This is a SHORT DD.  My first one since the prophetic $PLTR DD that got -700'd on February 5th before I finally deleted it and let those retards lose their asses (I'm never going to stop saying I told you so, bitches).  Bet that was harder to see coming than knowing Will Smith was going to become best friends with a toaster an hour before it happened, eh?  &amp;#x200B;  Actually, that's not entirely true.  This is a hybrid.    &amp;#x200B;  # Do TA's have feelings?

And it's sitting pretty damn close to that again.  Also, every time it's tested resistance and failed, it's dropped to at least the mid 700's, usually crossing into the 6's briefly, which presently serves as strong support.  It's presently trading near its ATH's not because of anything it's done, but rather because lately the trend has been to rotate into big growth companies again, forgetting that small and mid cap plays exist.  That's all well and good, but one off quarter and you're no longer contributing to the artificial inflation of the $SPY.  This has been a  reliable quiet swing trader for me, but it's now at a crucial pivot point that's going to require a strong catalyst to continue any upwards momentum.  That's bad news for a company reporting earnings in a time when even Wall Street darlings sell off even on great quarters.  At the very least, this is a rally that is quickly running out of gas, as evidenced by reduced volume.  With them reporting next week on the 20th, the pivot point of reckoning is upon us.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  # My logic is undeniable (or, to summarize):  &amp;#x200B;  * For the 2nd time in a row, an S&amp;P 500 company that operates on the fringes of traditional growth * Has positively ripped during this rotation from value into growth, in spite of all signals showing a down quarter and poor forward guidance as we are still in a period of Covidic uncertainty and what it means for the operating theatre * Has no known competitors, which has not pushed them to expand into other revenue channels besides crazy expensive machines meant to cover up for how few decent doctors are entering the workforce anymore * Is trading at a crucial resistance point that has been rejected forcefully 2 times in the past, with reduced volume each time * IV on calls is quite pricey, but puts are dirt cheap * If you really want dad's house, maybe make sure the ambulance sends him to Watts instead of Malibu.  Remember, if he ends up surviving the procedure, he's going to rat you out to the cops  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  # Price Targets:  &amp;#x200B;  I'm expecting a miss when they report earnings next week, or at the very least a very muted guidance.  As such, I would not be surprised to see this stonk slip all the way down into the 720-740 range before it regains some footing.  Barring some sort of catalyst, I'm having a hard time seeing how this is going to get over that 820 hump any time in the near future.  &amp;#x200B;  # How to play it.  That, detective, is the right question:  &amp;#x200B;  All the technical signs and oscillators are pointing to it becoming a very top heavy trade, which means it's primed for a much bigger negative breakout on the slightest weakness.    All that said, I certainly wouldn't go bear on it long-term.  $ISRG has never been one of the most violent movers, but it has a way of defying the odds, and has displayed that ability in the face of adversity for decades now.  I think if they miss next week and the stock goes into a freefall, be prepared to be nimble and cash out the put and switch back to long, even if it's not necessarily justified.  &amp;#x200B;  # Position Disclaimers:  &amp;#x200B;  I'm pretty sure I own more than a few shares of this in my managed asset portfolios and, even though my short-term outlook is bearish, am also fairly certain my fund managers aren't going to want to create a taxable event with them.  I'm holding 4/30 780 puts that I picked up for 10-ish bucks, as well as 5/28 $800p's.  I recently sold off my 7/16 795c's for a tidy profit.   Were I less of a pussy, I'd probably buy some 4/23 780p FD's.  Actually, I might do that for fun, anyways.  But remember, I'm gambling on a selloff on weakness.  If those further out puts print, I will cover them within a week or earnings and look for a consolidation pattern (probably a week or two later) to reverse course and buy some calls for another swing up.  &amp;#x200B;  **Word of caution:**  Buying puts on a mega tech in this environment is an inherently risky move because big money has been rotating into it for weeks now.    This is not a bet-the-house scenario.  I have about a 70% conviction this is gonna go my way, but that other 30% is pretty ugly and basically guarantees a complete loss.  And even if you do play this along with me and it prints, don't sit there and try to milk it for too long.  Some hedge fund could decide it's oversold at 735 and eat away at your tendies.  Fuck that guy.  And then go buy one of these, because fucking him is legally perilous and he might fight back - the robot will never say no.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/xgdhjx8bzht61.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65a7383f59faead4d0cfaffdd5a2118a63da15c9  &amp;#x200B;  All my love  &amp;#x200B;  \-Chad Dickens"

mryu3o,1618561474,Null-god,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mryu3o/amc_are_playing_both_the_short_and_the_long_term/,"AMC are playing both the short and the long term game and praise the retal investors.","Duh, not a financial advisor.  I loved every word of the interview with Adam Aron. He seems to be watching the market volume closely and plan his actions accordingly.  Quote from the article:  *"the movie-theater chain is once again “under attack” from short sellers after skirting bankruptcy during the Covid-19 pandemic.*  *The volume of short sales — bets that the stock will go down — rose about 50% in March to 73.8 million shares* *"*  Now, I'm not a market guru but I still believe that AMC are severely undervalued and heavily shorted. Yes, they've accumulated some debt but so have others and they survived through the worst of the pandemic one way or another, which means that the only way to go is UP.  If anything, they are on route to become winners after the pandemic since the ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific theatres have announced plans to close permanently.  *"Other theaters have succumbed to the Covid-19-struggle. ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific Theatres, two jointly owned California movie-theater chains, announced plans this week to close permanently, underscoring the still-tenuous state of the industry."*   The heavily discussed topic about the announcement to vote for the right to sell 500 million shares, which lead to significant price drop and short selling activity, has also been discussed by Adam Aron. The response:  *"If investors at the May 4 annual meeting approve the plan for additional stock, he’ll gain flexibility to buy back debt at a discount or acquire another chain at an attractive price, which would counteract any dilution."*  And more importantly:  *"Aron, who has long been known as outspoken, also praised the internet investors who see themselves as fighting against “conventional” market participants, like short sellers who profit when stock prices decline. He connected with Collins, who offers online investment commentary under the username Trey’s Trades, after his 30-year-old son saw a tweet that Collins had sent to his nearly 50,000 followers, known as “apes.”*  *“My hat’s off to you,” Aron said. “I’m well aware that you have been talking about AMC a lot over the last few months and you have, you know, hundreds of thousands of subscribers, tens and tens of thousands of people watching your shows on the YouTube channel,” Aron said.*  *“I actually work for you,” he said, “and for that reason it’s a special reason for me to engage with all of you.”*  Read the last paragraph again. He works for us. So is every CEO on this goddamn planet that you guys have stocks in and hold long term. But he is the one who publicly acknowledged it.   In summary:  1. Adam Aron acknowledged the rising activity in short selling which influences the price.  2. He acknowledges the debt so he is acting accordingly. 3. Competition (at least on the west coast) reduced. 4. He works for the "apes". 5. No plans to immediately sell the 500 million shares they announced. If things get tough, they have the right to sell 43 million shares to cover debt which means bankruptcy is NOT on the cards.  It was a tough year for the theatre giant but CEO Adam Aron believes in a bright future. It was a one in a generation economic and health crisis but AMC survived. The only way to go is UP.  P.S. Don't take this as a guarantee. Like many others here, It is my personal DD, not a financial advise. Stay safe.

mrw6sk,1618549012,factorof2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrw6sk/tech_industry_stock_compensation_or_how_i_learned/,"Tech Industry Stock Compensation or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Insider Selling (PLTR)","I posted this in the PLTR sub in response to a lot of threads I saw about insider selling and complaints about stock compensation models in tech companies. Figured I'd also post it here for anyone interested in my take (as a tech worker) on these things.     Okay the title is somewhat misleading because I don't necessarily **love** insider selling, but I've seen a lot of posts here and elsewhere especially on insider selling and I've found there's a misconception of stock-based compensation and selling by insiders. To preface, I am a software engineer for a large cap tech company and this is my take on stock-based compensation in the tech world and some basic things that I think all people should be aware of when it comes to this compensation and the insider selling that accompanies it.  To start I'll give a little background on the way stock compensation works for people on the ground. The grunts like me who do the normal day-to-day boring coding that enables the apps and products you use. I'll be using mostly the FAANG companies as examples of established public companies and the kind of compensation you see there.  &amp;#x200B;  **First things first: how does stock compensation work for most of these people?**  At most of these companies stock compensation is typically most heavy in the technical organizations of the company. That is to say, engineers are being compensated primarily in equity in the company in raw dollar terms, in some cases well over 50% of their yearly income. ***This difference is usually most prevalent in the first four years of employment.***  Why is that last sentence true? Because your initial grant of equity is typically one of the largest in order to "get you in the door." The cliff, as tech workers call it, at four years is the time at which an engineer will typically experience a net decrease in their overall income due to the fact that one of the largest grants they received expires at this time and their refresher grants are not as sizeable in dollar terms (excepting the most outstanding performers and the most rapid promotions, but these are very rare).  As a matter of fact, it's a well-known and oft-used strategy to bail from a company after your four year cliff and move to another or SIMPLY REAPPLY TO THE SAME COMPANY FOR ANOTHER INITIAL GRANT. Yes, this happens. I know people personally who have done it. You could call it mercenary behavior.  Personally, my total compensation every year is comprised of approximately 51% equity, 6.5% bonus, and the remaining 42.5% in salary (accounting for the current share price). And here's the important note about that: ***I am not by any means a stellar performer at the company***. I am at a senior level and meeting expectations well for my job and role but I am not in the upper bands of the most highly compensated individuals as a result of either stellar or lucky performance. I am well past my 4 year cliff though it doesn't matter, because I didn't begin my career as an engineer, which actually cost me a lot of money transferring to engineering. Remember those initial grants engineers get? Transfers don't get those. Point being: I am a decent engineer doing good work and my compensation is still driven mostly by equity. If I were getting much higher ratings, the percentage of my compensation driven by equity would be substantially larger.  Everything you've just read is pretty industry standard for these large caps as mentioned.  &amp;#x200B;  **Why is this such standard behavior in many companies?**  Isn't the answer obvious? If most of your highly lauded compensation is in stock you are driven to help your company succeed. And depending on your equity grant type maybe even more so.  Remember above how I said that the yearly equity I receive is currently 51% of my total compensation. That's because the share price is where it is. If tomorrow the share price drops by 50%... well that would be bad. You know what would make it worse? The fact that the other load of stock I have in the company isn't vested and just dropped SIGNIFICANTLY in value and depending on what triggered the drop could be heading towards zero.  That's because the company doesn't hire you and just hand you a fat stack of stock. You vest a portion of it over time, regularly. Industry standard for many of these companies is now that you vest a grant over 4 years at 1/16th each quarter. So for me, right around earnings season I get 1/16th of each grant I've received for the previous 4 years. The point of this is clearly to keep me invested and to keep me driving for my own success by advocating for and working on the best things for the business.  &amp;#x200B;  **What kind of stock grants are there?**  There are lots. But I'll quickly go over the one that people like Alex Karp deal with (joining a company well before going public) and the one I'm most familiar with: RSUs.  With RSUs, it's a pretty simple thing: the company will give you stock every quarter!  Okay so it's not quite this simple but close, and most importantly this is a taxable event - I'll talk about this next. The company hands you a cash bonus (basically) to buy the stock at the current market price and then you exercise that to buy the stock. Awesome! Except... you just got more income... and you have now locked all that money up in shares of your company. Uncle Sam would like a word with you about this.  With people like Alex Karp the situation is even more interesting: they are given options to the stock in the company. What does that mean? Exactly what you think it does. They are issued long call options with expirations and strikes against the stock. Alex Karp is in this situation now - he has over 60m options expiring that give him the ability to buy Palantir shares at the strike. However, the current price of the shares is well above his strike and the company is giving him compensation in the form of allowing him to buy the shares at their market rate for his strike. Uncle Sam would now like a word with Mr. Karp.  &amp;#x200B;  **So how do these taxes work?**  My company uses a sell to cover model. What does this mean? When I am issued shares my company will simply sell some of those shares after they are purchased in order to send the proceeds to the IRS. What this value represents is the expected value of the tax I would pay on the bonus I was granted to purchase the shares at the current market rate. Basically, I would sell 35% of my shares instantly to cover the expected 35% tax I would owe on the bonus I was granted to purchase the shares. This is pretty straightforward and for someone like me doesn't even really register as insider selling because it's not large enough in quantity and I'm not C suite or any of that. But this is a form of insider selling that is automatic to cover taxes. Read this if you want: [https://thefinancebuff.com/rsu-sell-to-cover-deconstructed.html](https://thefinancebuff.com/rsu-sell-to-cover-deconstructed.html)  With options it's a bit different because the income to purchase the stock (the bonus) would be the difference between the strike price of the calls given to the employee and the current price of the stock. So Alex Karp's over 60m shares are currently valued at well over a billion dollars. But that means the relative income that the company provided to cover his stock purchase is almost the entire value of the stock (his strikes are really low). Now he has a FUCK ALL MASSIVE TAX BILL on the income he was granted to purchase the stocks.  So when he exercises these options and then you read about him selling a few million shares, remember this - he is obligated to pay a 37% tax on the income granted to him to purchase those shares that he can either pay with his own money, selling a portion of his grant, or offsetting in some other way.  &amp;#x200B;  **These grants given to employees are not just brand new shares**  I've seen a bit of confusion about stock compensation specifically here so I'm going keep it short on this point - this sort of compensation is not just NEW SHARES FOR EVERY NEW GRANT!@!@!!!@@ That's not how it works. Dilution and new share issuance is a thing - but it's not the norm. If you're asking why they keep giving stock to people to work for them and that's why you think the price is dipping on things re-read this portion.  &amp;#x200B;  **Insider selling is predictable**  Why is this? Most of these people are using 10b5 plans to schedule their stock sales. Insiders are locked out of trading their own stock or even related derivatives the vast majority of the time. That includes grunts like me. Most stock sales that I conduct are for reinvestment purposes and taxes (these are automatic). But the common trait is they all happen after earnings because that's when our lockup period expires and we are granted our new shares. That's why you see people like Zuckerberg, Thiel, Pichai, Bezos, etc. selling at the same time all the time or as a result of a scheduled release. Think of a 10b5 as dollar cost averaging but for the sell side.  &amp;#x200B;  **Parting thought**  One of the main reasons I don't freak out when I see insider selling like we've seen here (unless it's dickhead Chamath and his SPACs which I won't touch because fuck that toolbox) is that I see this sort of sell-off all the time and because I understand a bit of the problem space Palantir is in. I actually used to work on the problem that got them to start this company while they were at PayPal: payments fraud. I also know that the industry really, really doesn't know how to handle problems like this as effectively as they think and that there are untapped places where software like this would be invaluable. Even in my own work, I can think of almost a half dozen places where this would be directly relevant to MY role in a large cap. I can only imagine the value if it were company wide.  ***Also, you guys know how I look at companies that try to recruit or poach me if they're not public companies?*** When I get messages from these series A and series B folks or stealth startups I almost always go in to look at what their growth potential is. I look at it as though I'm trying to do a value investment. What is their TAM? What will it be next year? What is their current valuation? How has it changed in their funding rounds? What sort of people work there and would I expect to build an amazing company with a ton of deep value with people like that? How do their finances and board structure look to me? Is this going to be attractive to other investors? Is the product they are offering going to be the best? Can I make it that?  What do all those questions boil down to: ***WHERE THE FUCK IS THEIR STOCK GOING?!***  Because here's the thing, most grunts like me who leave our cushy large cap jobs for places like this are doing so knowing full well that we are taking a pay cut. What are we looking for? To create the deep value that is going to drive that stock value way up and offer the best product so that the paper money we are promised to get in the door turns into some real money. What drives us to make it better? Knowing that we have more paper money left on the table that we also want to be worth something. That and most of us leave jobs for paper money for problems we love.

OK, Q4 is now in the rearview mirror, and the stock is trading below $18 per share.  Is that price warranted?  Some points to consider:  1) The market cap of the stock is now right around one billion dollars.  Does that sound reasonable for a company with $24 billion in annual revenue, positive cash flow, and $8 per share in adjusted EBITDA (during a COVID-19 stressed year, no less)?  2) The company provided guidance for the new / current Q1 of their 2022 fiscal year and indicated a break-even result +/- $10 million.  This represents a net earnings improvement of $63 to $83 million versus the prior year.  3) RAD management indicated they had administered 2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first six weeks of the new / current fiscal year.  Through the first half of the year, it appears 6 million doses will likely be delivered by Rite Aid.  This will result in $210 million in incremental revenue and $2 per share to net earnings.   Also, Pfizer's CEO mentioned today (April 15, 2021) that a third booster coronavirus shot will likely be required and that we should expect the COVID-19 vaccine to be administered annually like the flu shot.  4) The short attacks on the stock have ramped up this month leading into the earnings announcement.  On March 31, 2021 the short interest was 15.1%.  Not the highest we've ever seen, not by a long shot.  However, shorts are becoming more agressive in recent days:  * April 15th - 1,571,592 shares shorted (25.69% short volume ratio) * April 14th -    379,924 shares shorted (16.61% short volume ratio) * April 13th -    700,706 shares shorted (30.70% short volume ratio) * April 12th -    135,778 shares shorted (15.36% short volume ratio)  5) Bartell Drugs acquisition just recently closed.  Unlikely to contribute to net earnings during the current fiscal year, but is expected to do so next year.  The acquisition makes Rite Aid the pharmacy leader in the Seattle market.  6) Year-to-Date high share price is $32.48 and there are only 55 millioin shares total outstanding.  7) The company has $3.1 billion in debt, which is being adequately managed (---meaning Rite Aid was able to service the debt, buy Bartell drugs, and still maintain positive cash flow last year).  For the new / current fiscal year, it appears likely that Rite Aid is positioned to book positive net earnings and cash flow (improving cash flow even further).  8) Break-up value of the company is likely in the range of $40 - $50 per share.  Does this sound like a company that should be trading at less than $18 per share with a market cap of just $1 billion?  Don't hesitate to pile on with the abuse.  After today, I am used to it."

mrpky1,1618525214,718cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrpky1/plug_is_incredibly_oversold_and_way_under_current/,"PLUG is incredibly oversold and way under current stock valuation... And why it's going up at least 100%.","PLUG is down over 60% from it's ATH. The renewable energy market was overbought and PLUG needed a pullback, similar to TSLA/NIO/FCEL/etc.  Bad News:  It got hit with an accounting error because of their auditors, KPMG. PLUG (mainly KPMG) has to reinstate it's financial results from 2018 to 2020. This caused investors to lose trust and tumble the stock into way oversold territory. Most analysts summarized the accounting issues to appear as minor but short-term worrisome, and there's limited near-term upside until resolution. This issue was 1 month ago when PLUG was trading around $48. It's nearly fallen by 50% since then.  Multiple law firms, primarily lead by "Gross Law Firm", also announced a class action lawsuit against PLUG. Causing it to drop ~10% more. Looking into Gross Law Firm, that's their entire business model, suing companies on behalf of shareholders on stocks that aren't performing well enough. In April alone they have opened up 9 new lawsuits against varies companies. Records show that most are settled out of court or completely dropped. In 2018 Gross Law Firm also opened a class action lawsuit against Tesla and look where TSLA is now.  Good News:  Wall Street already grossly underestimates the hydrogen energy sector. Currently Wall Street is valuing Hydrogen Energy to be roughly 1% of the world's energy. But forecasts show by 2025 it'll be between 5-12%. PLUG is the leading green energy hydrogen company. The O&amp;G industry has reduced lobbying against Hydrogen Energy and is joining the sector: Chevron and Shell joined the Hydrogen Energy Council last year, and Exxon this year. The transition to Hydrogen Energy is starting to explode.  Last week PLUG was invited by the US department of defense to apply for a new $520 million loan guarantee. This news was still overshadowed by the accounting errors and hasn't reacted fully from it.  Upcoming news from the Biden administration will show they are ready, willing and able to provide strong support for hydrogen projects, increasing the valuating of PLUG.  Upon receiving approval from the DoE, PLUG will utilize its electrolyzer, liquefaction and distribution technologies to deploy the first resilient network of zero-carbon hydrogen production facilities across the United States. The facilities will have a combined liquid hydrogen generation capacity of approximately 180 tons per day.   Let's review their balance sheet. PLUG also has over 1.3B of cash on hand. 1.6B in current assets and 800M in other assets. It has roughly ONLY 236M in current liabilities giving PLUG a huge advantage to invest in future energy projects mentioned above. OR settle any accounting issues, fines, or lawsuits. BABA (45x larger company) settled a $2.4B fine and the shares JUMPED 9% because investors were no longer worried, uncertainty was behind them. When PLUG reinstates it's accounting issues the stock WILL jump. Also, PLUG's 2021 financial reports have no errors and do not need to be reinstated. This is a problem in their past they need to solve.  PLUG also already has major contract supply deals with many top companies, including Amazon and Walmart, which are also current investors of PLUG. PLUG is working with Walmart to provide it with fuel cell-powered vehicles. There are plans for expansion of this deal sometime in 2021.  Looking at current analyst's price targets, 69% (ayyy) of analyst say BUY, only 1 (6%) says to SELL. The LOWEST price target for PLUG is $29, nearly $3 lower than today's close. The HIGHEST is $78, just a few dollars short of its 52-week high. Average is $57, which is 115% upside. Read this again... the lowest... price target... on PLUG... is $29. That is HIGHER than its current stock price.  For those who care about TA, even with over a 500% 1Y gain on PLUG, PLUG has just reached oversold territory based on a RSI of 30. For shorter term traders: the 4h and 1h are also hovering around 30. The Stochastic lines have crossed in every time measure, and it's entering an uptrend off the lows of today. Even if you don't believe PLUG long term, there's potential for a quick gain as this flies back to its support of $28-32 in the week or two.  TL;DR: PLUG is grossly oversold and will bounce back to around $30 in a couple weeks. Good news is being overshadowed by an accounting error and when that problem is settled, PLUG will fly. Average price target is $58, but my price target is $75 by EoY. Based on cash flow, Biden administration push for renewable energy, clean energy sector growing, and PLUG's plan for Hydrogen production facilities and vehicle research/production, PLUG can easily hit that $75 price sooner.  Positions: I've already purchased 60k in $25 and $30 strike calls expiring 1/2023. I plan to increase that by another 40k soon. If PLUG hits the average analyst price target by January of next year, I'll close my position when it crosses $500,000 value."

Yes it is, but this RKT play also makes sense so it's worth getting out there.","I watch lines move all day, but this is not financial advice. Truly, do what you will with this info.   RKT has been seasoning for nearly a year. It has had time to establish a suppressed trend, and now it's time test new highs with a new trend very soon. This could also be last time to get in before the new trend establishes a higher floor.   We should know the company's fundamentals are solid at this point, just find all the DD on it and read up if you don't. They make bank and continue to innovate RAPIDLY. I've been in through it all since IPO.   **To more pressing matters, I believe there is a large option profit possibility here.**   I believe whales are trying to make a lot of money off of options with RKT. They tried last week and failed. This week has more attention so I yolo'd 200 calls before the bell today - $23 strikes were 15 cents each. It closed at 22.76 today.  Max pain was well below 22.5 today, and shorts got wrecked before close. I am up 33% on those calls already in 5 seconds (for now).   I am putting this out there because we'll need roughly 50 million in volume to gamma squeeze this bitch (see picture below for open interest at $23 04/16). **That's half the float in volume, but only double the daily average**. When it went to $43 in March we did 368 mil in volume.   There is 21k in open interest contracts at $23 calls 04/16s. There was a 10.5 million buy AH today (see picture). I saw another 89,920 share buy at 22.76 16:36:13 time stamp as I am typing this. Money is flowing in...why? My best guess is that the stock clearly is undervalued and institutions want to start making money on it sooner than later as they have been accumulating since IPO.   Due to the small float, this stock MOVES parabolic on volume. Great company as we know at this point, but the stock sucks most of the time. It's constantly suppressed, but on the days it's not boring, those green candle sticks sky rocket on a 90 degree angle like there is no tomorrow. Meaning...options earn profits really really fast. So if it happens, don't get too greedy because theta will burn your options quick. I am hoping for a 25.5 - 27  per share to exit my calls with hopes of exercising. If it doesn't start early in the day, then ill probably roll my calls over to next week.  To make this happen - we need a catalyst (which is a possibility big money knows something), or we just need some retail help when the attack begins. Fair value IMO is $65, but I'll take somewhere between 25-30 before earnings. Lifetime PT $350a share by 2023.   Just an FYI: this stock is notorious for false hope so expect the worse and hope for the best. I believe the low is $21 with a absolute worst case unlikely scenario of $18. So if you don't want to eff with the weeklies I would start buying shares here because it may not see $22 much longer and it's low risk to buy shares here IMO.  I also very confident in my June calls because they crush earnings every time - this will be their official 4th reported earnings as a public company.  I would anticipate that they want to leave the market will some fire news so that they utilize market cap for larger market share. RKT was never supposed to be a one hit wonder.   TLDR: I like the stock and you should too. Keep an eye on it tomorrow if you can. Do with this what you will.

This is my attempt to support a personal investment thesis that led to my put options positions. Tell me your thoughts in this DD. Did I miss something? Do you agree?  The following image shows a spliced version of a ten year chart to more easily compare the decline in the gold spot price during similar periods of economic stimulus.  &amp;#x200B;  [GOLD SPOT PRICE DROP REPEAT?](https://preview.redd.it/xxe410k9gdt61.jpg?width=380&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82efe65c4dc441a7130ce45912f94aa28cdb2cc2)  Much like we should expect in the 2013 reference, there are a few retests of highs, and the results were lower highs and lower lows. The yearlong trend was definitely downward. We see the same in the 2021 redline. These observations are obvious, but the important part of this spliced chart is the \~$200 drop in the spot price after failure of the fourth support test. I believe that this economic stimulus period will bring a repeat of that mid-2012 to mid-2013 time when investment capital shifted into confidence in the economic outlook. If I am correct, then a similar \~$200 drop in the gold spot price could be as near as tomorrow or as far as June. If the price drop is a % rather than a flat price drop, then the delta of the cliff could be between $250 or $300. In short, I believe gold approaches a \~15% cliff that could happen over a single day or week.  Even though I have been thinking about investing in gold product retailers mid-year (jewelry, electronic circuits and connectors), I have always preferred to invest in gold miners when I get that gold bug. I am not a bull or bear. I am a for-profit investor only. This increasing confidence in the economic outlook after so many challenges puts me in the bear camp now. When expecting big moves I usually consider trading in higher value names, and my recent positions in anticipation of this cliff down includes RGLD, a long established name in the gold trading sector that supports gold miners and gold investors as a "streams and royalties" company. I bought put options despite the jump in the gold spot price today, and the subsequent rise in the stock price of RGLD.  1. $115p May 21 '21 (x1) at cost $5.50 2. $115p May 21 '21 (x1) at cost $3.80 3. $115p Apr 16 '21 (x2) at cost $0.50  **TLDR:** I believe that the gold spot price approaches a \~15% cliff that could happen over a single day or week, and my bet is that RGLD will be a profitable short play because of its close relation to gold miners and the gold spot price."

For cattle, the most important factor quite honestly is the supply. More cattle than what is demanded (domestically or internationally) means subdued prices. Right now, this is the primary driver, as [young calves raised in late 2020](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/animal-products/cattle-beef/market-outlook/) in anticipation of economic recovery in early 2021 are showing up on the lots. As of right now, demand is OK - just OK with Americans coming back to restaurants, even though the rest of the world isn't. Like what was driving oil prices (up to yesterday when the IEA upgraded all forecasts), the rest of the world is significantly lagging the US in recovery.  2. Feed prices are critical to cattle as well (namely corn and soybeans). These have been on a tear in the past few weeks due to fewer than expected planted acres, and the current cold front across the midwest. If the feed becomes too expensive, it becomes more costly to fatten cattle, making less available to market, especially for the June contract as the time to fatten is now.  3. The backlog is about to end. The massive oversupply has been in play for about 6 months already - from October to April. Every commodity has seen the same cycle post-pandemic - a massive depressing of prices, only for the entire market to realize they've been too pessimistic, and then sudden rally.   &amp;#x200B;  It seems like cattle is one of the last agri laggard - corn, soy, hogs and lumber have already punched through the roof. I'm heavily in corn gang, but overall I'm bullish all soft commodities.

I have highlighted some of the key points on my analysis below  Company  Construction and utility provider MDU Resources (MDU) had a tough 2020.

This is a good sign for MDU and has a decent shot at beating earnings upcoming in early May * Balance of cyclical and counter cyclical business with almost a 50/50 split between construction and regulated energy. this bodes well for the long run and will likely be a stable performer in the market  **Runway of attractive organic and inorganic growth opportunities**  * Organic Growth: We are all familiar with the infrastructure spending bill that was passed in the UIS and MDU stand to benefit from this. * Inorganic Growth: **MDU Resources (MDU) Arm Buys Mt. Hood Rock, Expands in Portland (**[**here**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mdu-resources-mdu-arm-buys-163304894.html)**)** These investments will be aimed at enhancing the reliability of the company’s services, thus enabling it to serve an increasing customer base, effectively. MDU Resources anticipates its electric and natural gas utility segment to see a CAGR of 5% and expects its customer base to expand 1-2%, annually.  **Improving ROIC driven by rigorous capital allocation process**  * Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a calculation used to assess a company's efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments. The return on invested capital ratio gives a sense of how well a company is using its capital to generate profits. * A company is thought to be creating value if its ROIC exceeds 2% and destroying value if it is less than 2%. MDU Resources Group's ROIC % is 6.29% (calculated using TTM income statement data). * MDU Resources Group generates higher returns on investment than it costs the company to raise the capital needed for that investment. It is earning excess returns. A firm that expects to continue generating positive excess returns on new investments in the future will see its value increase as growth increases.  **Valuation**  I find MDU to be attractively priced at $31.29, with a blended PE of 15.9. This sits below MDU's historical PE of 19.4 over the past decade,  Analysts also express a bullish view on the stock, with a consensus Buy rating and an average price target of $34.33, implying a 10% upside potential from the current share price.  **Earnings**  Earnings are forecast to grow 6.74% per year and Earnings grew by 16.6% over the past year. If this trend continues, we will likely see a rise in the share price  **Insider Trading**  Significant insider buying over the last year with a majority of shares purchased in May 2020. This would make sense considering the price dropped off a cliff just a month prior. The management team knew it was a bargain and acted on the low share price  https://preview.redd.it/mm0ufvp1zct61.png?width=1409&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a48dd33dfa8bc4e1266ce88b085e687234e36f4  # Risks  **Biden’s Infrastructure Plan** \- While I see potential tailwinds for MDU's construction business from Biden's proposed infrastructure plan, there's no guarantee that such a proposal will pass. The construction business is more cyclical than the regulated utility business, and adds complexity risk to MDU's business model.  **Mild Dilution** \- MDU relies on both equity and debt to fund capital projects. This includes $100M in expected equity issuances this year, which will be mildly dilutive to shareholders  # TLDR  I'm encouraged by the impressive earnings it generated amidst a challenging economy. Based o some of the key factors and management guidance I see continued growth for MDU for the foreseeable future. I continue to find the valuation to be attractive and the dividend to be well-covered and safe. Consider looking at MDU and potentially adding it to your portfolio.

Personally, I think AMC has a ton of potential for several reasons:  1. 99% of AMC theaters are now open, and the pandemic has eliminated many of their competitors. Plus, there is a international surge in movie crowds as the pandemic seems to be slowing down 2. AMC is a great momentum stock almost certain to climb higher. It has gained 96.33% this past quarter while the S&amp;P have only moved up 2.3% respectively. 3. AMC has a zacks rank 2# (buy) ranking, basically saying that its positive earning outlook could easily translate to buying pressure which in turn would push the stock up.  Alright, these are my reasons, and whether you agree or not, thanks for reading and please comment on your thoughts.

The CEO of AMC has publicly promised yesterday to submit in writing with the SEC that AMC does not plan to issue any of the 500m shares if authorized by shareholders in May.   Happy to report that as of this morning AMC filed [Statement 14A](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/e5d2e721-c60b-4f74-9f90-7e970a8fc426.html) reiterating exactly what AA said in the interview:     &gt;**Adam Aron**: We are going to pledge right now today publicly and we will file this publicly so it will be binding on us, because you can’t announce intentions and then not carry through it, we hereby pledge at AMC that if the shareholders approve this authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued we will not use one of those 500 million shares in calendar year 2021. Not one. Not one.   &gt;. . .   &gt;**Adam Aron**: If we need to raise some cash in the short term, remember we already have 43 million shares that are out there that were authorized in the year 2013 that we could use if we wish to raise some cash, if we decide that’s a good idea. We have made no decisions yet. We are thinking about it, but we haven’t made any decisions yet.  This is a cause for cautious celebration - the CEO stands by his statement, and is serious about keeping the promise.   But, the emphasis is on cautious. First rule of sound investing - read the fine print. That’s how they screw you.    &gt;Should one or more of these risks, trends, uncertainties or facts [listed above] materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by the forward-looking statements contained herein. **Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.** Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved.  Let me unpack this for you. **AMC is saying that if any of the bad things they listed in the statement happen  they will not hesitate one moment to issue more shares.**. Theater openings delayed? More shares. AMC can’t pay its interest and debt on schedule? More shares. Motion pictures companies don’t want to screen their movies at theaters for months and go to their own digital platform after two weeks? You got it, more shares.   **STAY DILIGENT AND DO WHATS BEST FOR YOUR WALLET**  Seen many people switch to an automatic “yes” on their vote. I won’t be one of those people.   I’m not an advisor or your advisor, financial or otherwise. I’m just a guy with thousands of AMC shares who likes to read the fine print and make weighted decisions based on facts.   Full disclosure - I sold a third of my April 2019 shares in January to recoup basis and take profits. The rest is in for the ride as it’s all pure profit, so naturally I want it to go as high as possible.  TLDR: good news the CEO stood by his promise. Bad news they can still issue more shares if the situation gets worse this year. My “no” vote stands."

This may sound stupid but it’s actually the most logical play that know one is thinking or talking about. So TLRY is buying out APHA and therefore your APHA shares will convert to TLRY shares. TLRY is the bigger more valuable company. If you have 500 dollars in APHA it will be converted to TLRY regardless of the share price.    Here’s where the hidden logic comes in. The best play is to accumulate as much APHA and drive the price up as high as possible, squeeze out the rest of the shorts and hold.  On the other end of the spectrum sell all of your TLRY shares and beat this ticker to the curb. The lower this goes the better. TLRY actually has a high short interest but trust me let the gay bears have this one.  If the APHA shares can surpass the price of the TLRY shares it will be bigger than the original moon landing.    Once the merger happens those who have 💎👐’s will be rewarded with more TLRY shares than they had APHA shares.  TLRY will then way undervalued and everyone will start to pile in.  If you still don’t get it, imagine TSLA buying out NKLA, you’d want NKLA to be as high as possible at the merger and TSLA as low as possible.  I’ve been buying this APHA dip and ready to watch it rip while hoping to see TLRY plummet🚀🚀🚀🌕💎👐‘s"

mr5spq,1618454005,SpaceBound6991,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr5spq/coin_moon_potential/,"$COIN = MOON POTENTIAL","Have been seeing a lot of negativity around Coinbase so wanted to provide an echo chamber for us bulls who FOMO'd in near the open.  First off, Coinbase should not be valued as an exchange, it makes no sense to compare it to Nasdaq or NYSE. COIN is rapidly growing, has a vastly different transaction structure, and is beginning to expand into the services market.  Now let's get into some numbers. 2020 Revenue was 1.28 B which is 140% growth over 2019, that is ridiculous. The really crazy number, 1.8 B in revenue for Q1 2021. They had 50% more revenue in Q1 2021 than the entirety of 2020. Let that sink in for a minute. Net Income for Q1 2021 was also around 750 M. If they were to sustain this net income for the rest of the year, that would put them at a 28 P/E ratio... for a company growing this quick? It's important to keep in mind that this was a record quarter for COIN and likely not sustainable near term but it still shows what they are capable of.   Additionally, they announced that they are up to 56 million users with 6.1 of those being Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) in Q1 2021. This is a massive jump over the previous quarter and COIN explains that the rise in MTUs is largely due to the increase in price and volatility around virtual currencies. For some reference, Robinhood has 13 million monthly users but get nowhere near the revenue per user that COIN does. These "virtual currencies" have continued increasing so far in Q2 2021 so I am expecting another knockout quarter in both revenue and MTUs. Expect the Q2 earnings report to blow past expectations (think massive tendie spike).  Speaking of those beefy transaction fees that COIN gets, there's no way that's sustainable right? It's going to be a race to the bottom, just like the stock trading fees? Well, not exactly. Investors love how simple Coinbase makes trading and are willing to pay a small premium for this ease of use. Currently, fees are massive percentagewise for small trades but become pretty reasonable at a large scale. I could see them lowering rates significantly for these small trades once they build up some more consistent institutional trading revenue and service revenue.   There's probably some reason to worry about declining margins in the transaction side of the business, however, that's not why COIN deserves to hit $500+. Coinbase's services platform is massively undervalued and is something the mainstream media largely ignores. This segment of the business is growing very quickly and should not be overlooked. If you look at what Cathie Wood says about digital wallets, it should be clear how much potential Coinbase has to monetize it's users. It's creating an entire financial ecosystem built around Coinbase that's designed to keep users around.   Position: Shares of $COIN  Price Targets: $550 by EOY, $800 by end of 2022"

Come on dude, do better"  The reason I pasted the 2 links, as a response to the post was to show that there are no updated positions as of 3/31/2021 from Black Rock Fund Advisors.

You can see that just after that date of the most recent 13F-HR (Filed 2017-02-10), Black Rock Fund Advisors has not submitted any more 13F-HR forms to note their positions.

Black Rock Inc had very few GME shares.  &amp;#x200B;  But let's analyze the next 13F-HR submitted by Black Rock Inc on 2017-05-12:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/j8wprt8kx7t61.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9582010b2ef6a34535c4180c3019a183a3257b01  Soruce: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001364742/000108636417000069/xslForm13F\_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001364742/000108636417000069/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml)  But it's magic!!!!

The evolutions of those GME positions over time you can check for yourself.  &amp;#x200B;  Let's come to the other point made by the user   "Also, in your Fidelity sale filing, pay attention to section 7. They moved the securities to another company.  "Item 7. Identification and Classification of the Subsidiary Which Acquired the Security Being Reported on By the Parent Holding Company.  See attached Exhibit A."  Here he is referring to an old post that came out at the time of the Fidelity GME sale posted on the GME forum. I have already replied to this kind of comment and I paste one of my answers:  I've already been shown the thread you mean ( you can find it in the comments on my post on s u p e r s t o n k ). The author of the post is simply wrong because:  &amp;#x200B;  1 - There is no reference whatsoever to a transfer of shares  2- But let's say for sure that the author is right, where is the new SEC filing? Why on bloomberg terminal has disappeared fidelity from January 29 onwards?  3- If there had been a real transfer there would be SEC filings with different C    I      K's.  &amp;#x200B;  I would like to add that after reading what I have written here, it should be clearer why Fidelity has SOLD and not moved shares.  &amp;#x200B;  I want to conclude by saying that after posting my GME counter DD, I received many positive comments that understood what I was talking about but also many others that did not understand. It's okay to not understand some things, I didn't understand them when I started either. But I get annoyed by those who try to counter what I have written with really meaningless arguments that only show that they have not understood anything about the subject and have little knowledge on the subject. This is why I sometimes respond badly."

Of course, this is a wendy's, not a financial consultancy, so this is not advice, but APHA's slide as of late is quite contrary to future market expectations with NY legalization and VA speeding things along. Schumer and the Dems have indicated legalization is a priority. Biden will probably(?) sign it.  APHA is at a large discount following this week's slide. (Roughly a 14% discount to be exact.) Consider that an APHA share = .83 TLRY shares and you have a pretty substantial gain to be made if you buy APHA at this price and it converts to TLRY at the current price of $17.40. My crayon-napkin math indicates a gain of about 2-3% using current prices.  On top of that, the combined entity TLRY (following the merger) will be the largest weed company by revenue, meaning they'll likely be able to swallow a lot of market share in the US and EU following U.S. legalization, the EU thing is already ongoing.  APHA as a discounted TLRY share is pretty good right now, especially because they move in parallel with TLRY always being more valuable. From there, seems like a hold on TLRY, which most actual advisors seem to agree with."

Despite the fact that some retail investors think that those kind of events are some huge catalysts, they are just events that are intended to show investors and potential customers the capabilities of the company's products.  However, retail investors hype themselves up and buy the stock just before the event, cuz they either think that others will follow suite or that they will show some ridiculous, innovative technology or product. This of course does not happen, so they immediatly sell their shares, cuz they were in for the short-term anyway. At battery day Elon showed the huge progress that Tesla have made on potentially world-changing battery technology, but shares dumped by more than 15 percent the next day for the following reasons - 1- Tesla did not show an electric jet or a flying car 2. They did not understand anything about what was said and found the event boring 3.They were short-term traders that just played the catalyst. The same thing happened on the day that Apple showed the new Iphone- runup before the event and dump after. Both stocks are up big today.  Now before you ask why didn't you sell your shares if you expected the share price to decrease, I will tell you. Most successful investors will tell you that if you actually believe in the long-term growth of the company, you should not try to time the market. I bought PLTR's CFD's (certificates for difference) at DPO and almost convinced myslef to sell at 15, cuz I throught that the rally will be unsustainable in the short-term, but I am glad that I did not do that and instead I sold at 30. I bought shares this time at 24 average price. Of course I know that even if you are a long-term investor you will still want the share price to increase in the short-term ( there is something called opportunity cost) and I personally would like it better if the company was more transparent with the media and investors, but it is what it is. Just remember that the share price will definitely increase only if PLTR accelerates its revenue growth and customer acquisitions, everything else is speculation.  This is not a financial advice and I promise you that Peter Thiel is not funding my posts."

I've known at some point that /r/wallstreetbets will have to find a place for it.

I don't see the point in delaying the inevitable anymore as crypto is here to stay.

But management intentionally dropped it as USPS couldn't make 2 day delivery or the fast delivery requirements that is necessary to compete.  The market reacted very badly for this short-term bump in the road. But COVID-19 has proved that management was right all along and it was absolutely necessary to drop that deal to grow the company.  **Conclusion:** I think the stock will pretty reliably beat the upcoming earning and the stock will jump heavily before the earnings only to dump a little or a lot after the earnings. Basically, buy the rumour, sell... However, the stock is also a prett decent one for long term holdings too.  **TL;DR: STMP will at least reach $270+ before earnings come out.

[https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-07676.pdf](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-07676.pdf)  The purpose of the proposed rule change is to enhance the Exchange’s Retail Price Improvement Program for the **benefit of retail investors.** Specifically, the Exchange proposes to make the following four changes: (i) revise the definition of Retail order in IEX Rule 11.190(b)(15) to **apply only to the trading interest of a natural person that does not place more than 390 equity orders per day** on average during a calendar month for its own beneficial account(s);7 (ii) **provide Order Book8 priority to Retail Liquidity Provider (“RLP”) orders9 at the Midpoint Price10 ahead of other non-displayed orders priced to execute at the Midpoint Price;** (iii) disseminate a “Retail Liquidity Identifier” through the Exchange’s proprietary market data feeds and the appropriate securities information processor (“SIP”) when RLP order interest aggregated to form at least one round lot for a particular security is available in the System,11 provided that the RLP order interest is resting at the Midpoint Price and is **priced at least $0.001 better than the NBB12 or NBO13**; and (iv) amend the definition of RLP orders so **such orders can only be midpoint peg orders**,14 cannot be Discretionary Peg orders,15 and cannot include a minimum quantity restriction.16 The proposed changes are designed to further support and enhance the ability of non-professional retail investors to obtain meaningful price improvement by incentivizing market participants to compete to provide such price improvement.  Retail Liquidity Provider means a broker that routes retail orders through the IEX. You can call your broker and see if they are an RLP for IEX.  The largest change here is ii listed above. This completely negates the ability for other firms to see retail orders before execution and then act accordingly to manipulate the price. This would give retail orders **Priority over other non-displayed orders. It would also make market orders forced to trade at the midpoint price (Ie between ask and bid). Previously, this could be manipulated to decrease the price by consistently filling orders at lower and lower prices so that even though people are buying, the price drops.**  Read some of the DD to learn a bit on how **non displayed orders** are likely being used by citadel and friends to manipulate the price.  Overall, it seems like a major step in the right direction to help level the playing field. It looks like it has to go through the traditional comment period before approval. (Not an advance notice).  Still reading will add more as needed."

We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.  Here's why:  * A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread ("Commentposting")    * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.    * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.       * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares.

If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.       * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts. * A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT    * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs. * A submission is purely political    * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal. * A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging    * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.  You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

This will be $350+ before you blink.  On their exchange it was trading a tokenized version for $600 which was approx $150B marketcap.  Realistically anything $350 or beyond is speculation as it’ll be priced beyond perfection.  So how to make money...?  A rising tide lifts all boats.  Two companies in same space are flying under the radar, Bakkt ($v i h) and eToro ($f t c v).  Marketcap are right now $3B and $14b.    Bakkt is fully regulated, majority owned by ICE/NYSE (owns 76%), Steven Cohen owns 5.6%, and has 3.3 million shares short which could trigger a squeeze today through end of week if this gets volume today.  Fully regulated, started by selling futures on b1tcoin, and just launched their retail digital wallet. Who says digital wallets are the future?  Mama Woods: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/13/cathie-wood-sees-these-2-trends-as-the-next-big-things-after-electric-vehicles.html  EToro is a platform to buy/sell crypt0 and stocks.  It’s focus is in Europe and just expanding into US now.  Their revenue is about 1/3 the size of $Coin but it’s marketcap could be as small as 1/10 of $coin (depends where $coin goes today).  Robinhood wants to ipo at $50B and eToro is same size.  Again a high volume day here as a sympathy play could result in big gains rest of week.  If people don’t want to put $350 into $coin they are going to look for next best thing.  I think a lot of them will land here.    Imo both of these will run today and rest of week.  I would not be surprised at all to see either one double by week’s end.  Glta."
